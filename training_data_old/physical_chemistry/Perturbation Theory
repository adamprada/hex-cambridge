effect Electronelectron Coulomb repulsionContributors and Attributions In most practical applications of quantum mechanics to molecular problems one is faced with the harsh reality that the Schrödinger equation pertinent to the problem at hand cannot be solved exactly To illustrate how desperate this situation is I note that neither of the following two Schrödinger equations has ever been solved exactly meaning analytically The Schrödinger equation for the two electrons moving about the He nucleus The Schrödinger equation for the two electrons moving in an molecule even if the locations of the two nuclei labeled A and B are held clamped as in the BornOppenheimer approximation These two problems are examples of what is called the threebody problem meaning solving for the behavior of three bodies moving relative to one another Motions of the sun earth and moon even neglecting all the other planets and their moons constitute another threebody problem None of these problems even the classical Newtons equation for the sun earth and moon have ever been solved exactly So what does one do when faced with trying to study real molecules using quantum mechanics There are two very powerful tools that one can use to sneak up on the solutions to the desired equations by first solving an easier model problem and then using the solutions to this problem to approximate the solutions to the real Schrödinger problem of interest For example to solve for the energies and wave functions of a boron atom one could use hydrogenic orbitals but with and hydrogenic and orbitals with to account for the screening of the full nuclear charge by the two electrons as a starting point To solve for the vibrational energies of a diatomic molecule whose energy vs bond length is known one could use the Morse oscillator wave functions and energies as starting points But once one has decided on a reasonable model to use how does one connect this model to the real system of interest Perturbation theory and the variational method are the two tools that are most commonly used for this purpose and it is these two tools that are covered in this Chapter The perturbation theory approach provides a set of analytical expressions for generating a sequence of approximations to the true energy and true wave function This set of equations is generated for the most commonly employed perturbation method RayleighSchrödinger perturbation theory RSPT as follows First one decomposes the true Hamiltonian into a socalled zerothorder part this is the Hamiltonian of the model problem used to represent the real system and the difference which is called the perturbation and usually denoted It is common to associate with the perturbation a strength parameter which could for example be associated with the strength of the electric field when the perturbation results from the interaction of the molecule of interest with an electric field In such cases it is usual to write the decomposition of as A fundamental assumption of perturbation theory is that the wave functions and energies for the full Hamiltonian can be expanded in a Taylor series involving various powers of the perturbation parameter Hence one writes the energy and the wave function as zeroth first second etc order pieces which form the unknowns in this method E E E E E cdots with and being proportional to Next one substitutes these expansions of and into This produces one equation whose right and left hand sides both contain terms of various powers in the perturbation For example terms of the form and and are all of third power also called third order Next one equates the terms on the left and right sides that are of the same order This produces a set of equations each containing all the terms of a given order The zeroth first and secondorder such equations are given below It is straightforward to see that the nth order expression in this sequence of equations can be written as The zerothorder equation simply instructs us to solve the model Schrödinger equation to obtain the zerothorder wave function and its zerothorder energy Since is a Hermitian operator it has a complete set of such eigenfunctions which we label and E_k One of these states will be the one we are interested in studying eg we might be interested in the effect of an external electric field on the state of the hydrogen atom but as will become clear soon we actually have to find the full set of and eg we need to also find the etc states of the hydrogen atom when studying the electric fields effect on the state In the firstorder equation the unknowns are and recall that is assumed to be known because it is the difference between the Hamiltonian one wants to solve and the model Hamiltonian To solve the firstorder and higherorder equations one expands each of the corrections to the wave function of interest in terms of the complete set of wave functions of the zerothorder problem As noted earlier this means that one must solve not just for the zerothorder state one is interested in denoted above but for all of the other zerothorder states For example expanding in this manner gives Now the unknowns in the firstorder equation become and the expansion coefficients To solve one proceeds as follows First one multiplies this equation on the left by the complex conjugate of the zerothorder function for the state of interest and integrates over the variables on which the wave functions depend This gives The first and third terms cancel one another because and the fourth term reduces to because is assumed to be normalized This allows the above equation to be written as which is the RSPT expression for It says the firstorder correction to the energy of the unperturbed state can be evaluated by computing the average value of the perturbation with respect to the unperturbed wave function Returning to the firstorder equation and multiplying on the left by the complex conjugate of one of the other zerothorder functions gives Using H the first term reduces to and the fourth term vanishes because is orthogonal to because these two functions are different eigenfunctions of This reduces the equation to The unknown in this expression is which is the expansion coefficient for the expansion of in terms of the zerothorder functions In RSPT one assumes that the only contribution of to the full wave function psioccurs in zerothorder this is referred to as assuming intermediate normalization of y In other words because and for So the coefficients appearing in the above equation are all one needs to describe If the state of interest is nondegenerate in zerothorder ie none of the other is equal to E this equation can be solved for the needed expansion coefficients which allow the firstorder wave function to be written as where the index is restricted such that not equal the state you are interested in However if one or more of the zerothorder energies is equal to an additional step needs to be taken before the above expression for can be used If one were to try to solve without taking this extra step the values for those states with could not be determined because the first and third terms would cancel and the equation would read The way RSPT deals with this paradox is realize that within a set of degenerate states any orthogonal combinations of these states will also be degenerate So RSPT assumes that one has already chosen the degenerate sets of zerothorder states to make for This extra step is carried out in practice by forming the matrix representation of in the original set of degenerate zerothorder states and then finding the unitary transformation among these states that diagonalizes this matrix These transformed states are then what one uses as and in the RSPT expressions This means that the paradoxical result is indeed obeyed by this choice of states so one does not need to determine the coefficients for belonging to the degenerate zerothorder states ie these coefficients can be assumed to be zero The bottom line is that the expression remains valid but the summation index is now restricted to exclude any members of the zerothorder states that are degenerate with To obtain the expression for the secondorder correction to the energy of the state of interest one returns to Multiplying on the left by the complex conjugate of and integrating yields The intermediate normalization condition causes the fourth term to vanish and the first and third terms cancel one another Recalling the fact that is normalized the above equation reduces to Substituting the expression obtained earlier for allows to be written as where as before the sum over is limited to states that are not degenerate with in zerothorder These are the fundamental working equations of RayleighSchrödinger perturbation theory They instruct us to compute the average value of the perturbation taken over a probability distribution equal to to obtain the firstorder correction to the energy They also tell us how to compute the firstorder correction to the wave function and the secondorder energy in terms of integrals coupling to other zerothorder states and denominators involving energy differences An analogous approach is used to solve the second and higherorder equations For example the equation for the nth order energy and wave functions reads The nth order energy is obtained by multiplying this equation on the left by and integrating over the relevant coordinates and using the fact that is normalized and the intermediate normalization condition for all This allows one to recursively solve for higher and higher energy corrections once the various lowerorder wave functions are obtained To obtain the expansion coefficients for the expanded in terms of the zerothorder states one multiplies the above order equation on the left by one of the zerothorder states not equal to the state of interest and obtains The last term on the righthand side vanishes because and are orthogonal The terms containing the nth order expansion coefficients can be brought to the lefthand side to produce the following equation for these unknowns langlepsi_J psinrangle E langlepsi_J psinrangle langle psi_JV psinrangle E langlepsi_J psinrangle E langlepsi_Jpsinrangle E langle psi_Jpsinrangle En langle psi_Jpsirangle As long as the zerothorder energy is not degenerate with or that the zerothorder states have been chosen as discussed earlier to cause there to no contribution to from such degenerate states the above equation can be solved for the expansion coefficients which then define The RSPT equations can be solved recursively to obtain even highorder energy and wave function corrections and and are used to determine and as outlined above is determined from with and the expansion coefficients of are determined from the above equation with and higher are then determined from and the expansion coefficients of are determined from the above equation with This process can then be continued to higher and higher order Although modern quantum mechanics uses highorder perturbation theory in some cases much of what the student needs to know is contained in the first and second order results to which I will therefore restrict our further attention I recommend that students have in memory their own brain not a computer the equations for and so they can make use of them even in qualitative applications of perturbation theory as we will discuss later in this Chapter But first lets consider an example problem that illustrates how perturbation theory is used in a more quantitative manner An Example Problem As we discussed earlier an electron moving in a quasilinear conjugated bond framework can be modeled as a particle in a box An externally applied electric field of strength interacts with the electron in a fashion that can described by adding the perturbation to the zerothorder Hamiltonian Here is the position of the electron in the box is the electrons charge and is the length of the box The perturbation potential varies in a linear fashion across the box so it acts to pull the electron to one side of the box First we will compute the firstorder correction to the energy of the state and the firstorder wave function for the state In the wave function calculation we will only compute the contribution to made by this is just an approximation to keep things simple in this example Let me now do all the steps needed to solve this part of the problem Try to make sure you can do the algebra but also make sure you understand how we are using the firstorder perturbation equations The zerothorder wave functions and energies are given by and and the perturbation is The firstorder correction to the energy for the state having and denote is The first integral can be evaluated using the following identity with The second integral can be evaluated using the following identity with and Making all of these appropriate substitutions we obtain This result that the firstorder correction to the energy vanishes could have been foreseen In the expression for the product is an even function under reflection of through the midpoint in fact this is true for all of the particleinabox wave functions On the other hand the perturbation is an odd function under reflection through Thus the integral must vanish as its integrand is an odd function This simple example illustrates how one can use symmetry to tell ahead of time whether the integrals and contributing to the firstorder and higherorder energies and wave functions will vanish The contribution to the firstorder wave function made by the state is given by The two integrals in the numerator involve and Using the integral identities and intcosaxdx fracasinax we obtain the following and int_L xsinleftdfrac pi xLrightsinleftdfracpi xLrightdx fracleftint_L xcosleftdfracpi xLrightdx int_L xcosleftdfracpi xLrightdxright fracleft

Making all of these appropriate substitutions we obtain for the firstorder wave function actually only the contribution So the wave function through first order ie the sum of the zeorth and firstorder pieces is In Figure we show the and zerothorder functions as well as the superposition function formed when the zerothorder and firstorder functions combine Figure blue and red particleinabox zerothorder functions left and the perturbed function through first order right arising from the electric field polarization Clearly the external electric field acts to polarize the wave function in a manner that moves its probability density toward the side of the box The degree of polarization will depend on the strength of the applied electric field For such a polarized superposition wave function there should be a net dipole moment induced in the system We can evaluate this dipole moment by computing the expectation value of the dipole moment operator with being the sum of our zeroth and firstorder wave functions In computing this integral we neglect the term proportional to because we are interested in only the term linear in because this is what gives the dipole moment Again allow me to do the algebra and see if you can follow where e int_L psileftxfracLrightpsi dx e int_L psileftxfracLrightpsi dx e int_L psileftxfracLrightpsi dx e int_L psileftxfracLrightpsi dx The first integral is zero we discussed this earlier when we used symmetry to explain why this vanishes The fourth integral is neglected since it is proportional to and we are interested in obtaining an expression for how the dipole varies linearly with The second and third integrals are identical and can be combined to give Substituting our earlier expressions for and we obtain These integrals are familiar from what we did to compute doing them we finally obtain Now Lets compute the polarizability of the electron in the state of the box and try to understand physically why a should depend as it does upon the length of the box To compute the polarizability we need to know that Using our induced moment result above we then find Notice that this finding suggests that the larger the box ie the length of the conjugated molecule the more polarizable the electron density This result also suggests that the polarizability of conjugated polyenes should vary nonlinearly with the length of the conjugated chain Other Examples Lets consider a few more examples of how perturbation theory is used in chemistry either quantitatively ie to actually compute changes in energies and wave functions or qualitatively ie to interpret or anticipate how changes might alter energies or other properties The Stark effect When a molecule is exposed to an electric field its electrons and nuclei experience a perturbation V textbfE cdot esum_n Z_n textbfR_n e sum_i textbfr_i where is the charge of the nucleus whose position is is the position of the electron and is the unit of charge The effect of this perturbation on the energies is termed the Stark effect The firstorder change to the energy of this molecule is evaluated by calculating where is the unperturbed wave function of the molecule ie the wave function in the absence of the electric field The quantity inside the integral is the electric dipole operator so this integral is the dipole moment of the molecule in the absence of the field For species that possess no dipole moment eg nondegenerate states of atoms and centrosymmetric molecules this firstorder energy vanishes It vanishes in the two specific cases mentioned because is either even or odd under the inversion symmetry but the product is even and the dipole operator is odd so the integrand is odd and thus the integral vanishes If one is dealing with a degenerate state of a centrosymmetric system things are different For example the and states of the hydrogen atom are degenerate so to apply perturbation theory one has to choose specific combinations that diagonalize the perturbation This means one needs to first form the x matrix leftbeginarraycc langle s V s rangle langle s V p_z rangle langle p_z V s rangle langle p_z V p_z rangle endarrayright where is taken to be the direction of the electric field The diagonal elements of this matrix vanish due to parity symmetry so the two eigenvalues are equal to These are the two firstorder because they are linear in and thus linear in energies So in such degenerate cases one can obtain linear Stark effects The two corrected zerothorder wave functions corresponding to these two shifted energies are and correspond to orbitals polarized into or away from the electric field The Stark effect example offers a good chance to explain a fundamental problem with applying perturbation theory One of the basic assumptions of perturbation theory is that the unperturbed and perturbed Hamiltonians are both bounded from below ie have a discrete lowest eigenvalues and allow each eigenvalue of the unperturbed Hamiltonian to be connected to a unique eigenvalue of the perturbed Hamiltonian Considering the example just discussed we can see that these assumptions are not met for the Stark perturbation Consider the potential that an electron experiences within an atom or molecule close to a nucleus of charge It is of the form in atomic units where the energy is given in Hartrees H eV and distances in Bohr units Bohr Å where the first term is the Coulomb potential acting to attract the electron to the nucleus and the second is the electronfield potential assuming the field is directed along the direction In Figure a we show this potential for a given value of the angle Figure a Potential experienced by valence electron showing attraction to a nucleus located at the origin the deep well and the potential due to the applied electric field Along directions for which is negative to the right in Figure a this potential becomes large and positive as the distance of the electron from the nucleus increases for bound states such as the and states discussed earlier such regions are classically forbidden and the wave function exponentially decays in this direction However in directions along which is positive the potential is negative and strongly attractive for smallr ie near the nucleus then passes through a maximum eg near in Figure a at where ca eV in Figure a and then decreases monotonically as r increases In fact this potential approaches as approaches as we see in the left portion of Figure a The bottom line is that the total potential with the electric field present violates the assumptions on which perturbation theory is based However it turns out that perturbation theory can be used in such cases under certain conditions For example as applied to the Stark effect for the degenerate and levels of a hydrogenic atom ie a oneelectron system with nuclear charge if the energy of the and states lies far below the maximum in the potential perturbation theory can be used We know the energies of hydrogenic ions vary with and with the principal quantum number as So as long as the zerothorder energy of the state will like below the barrier on the potential surface Because the wave function can penetrate this barrier this state will no longer be a true bound state it will be a metastable resonance state recall we studied such states in Chapter where we learned about tunneling However if the zerothorder energy lies far below the barrier the extent of tunneling through the barrier will be small so the state will have a long lifetime In such cases we can use perturbation theory to describe the effects of the applied electric field on the energies and wave functions of such metastable states but we must realize that we are only allowed to do so in the limit of weak fields and for states that lie significantly below the barrier In this case perturbation theory describes the changes in the energy and wave function in regions of space where the zerothorder wave function is bound but does not describe at all the asymptotic part of the wave function where the electron is unbound Another example of Stark effects in degenerate cases arises when considering how polar diatomic molecules rotational energies are altered by an electric field The zerothorder wave functions appropriate to such cases are given by where the spherical harmonic is the rotational wave function is the vibrational function for level and is the electronic wave function The diagonal elements of the electricdipole operator vanish because the vibrationally averaged dipole moment which arises as is a vector quantity whose component along the electric field is again taking the field to lie along the direction Thinking of as so is the integrals because is an even function of ie of Because the angular dependence of the perturbation ie has no dependence matrix elements of the form also vanish This means that if one were to form the matrix representation of for the degenerate states belonging to a given all of its elements would be zero Thus the rotational energies of polar diatomic or rigid linear polyatomic molecules have no firstorder Stark splittings There will however be secondorder Stark splittings in which case we need to examine the terms that arise in the formula For a zerothorder state only certain other zerothorder states will have nonvanishing coupling matrix elements These nonzero integrals are governed by which can be shown to be of course if the term does not occur The limitation that must equal arises as above because the perturbation contains no terms dependent on the variable The limitation that comes from a combination of three conditions angular momentum coupling which you learned about in Chapter tells us that which happens to be proportional to can couple to to generate terms having or for their quantum number but only for their quantum number the and factors arising from the product must match for the integral not to vanish because finally the terms will vanish because of the inversion symmetry is odd under inversion but is even Using the fact that the perturbation is these two nonzero matrix elements can be used to express the secondorder energy for the level as EtextbfElanglemurangleleftdfracdfracJMJJBJ dfracdfracJMJJBJright where is Plancks constant and is the rotational constant for the molecule for a diatomic molecule of reduced mass and equilibrium bond length Before moving on to another example it is useful to point out some common threads that occur in many applications of perturbation theory and that will also be common to variational calculations that we discuss later in this Chapter Once one has identified the specific zerothorder state of interest one proceeds as follows The firstorder energy is evaluated In doing so one should first make use of any symmetry point group symmetry is treated later in this Chapter such as inversion angular momentum spin etc to determine whether this expectation value will vanish by symmetry in which case we dont bother to consider this matrix element any more We used this earlier when considering and to conclude that certain firstorder energies are zero If vanishes so the lowestorder effect is in second order or if we want to examine higherorder corrections we consider evaluating Before doing so explicitly we think about whether symmetry will limit the matrix elements entering into the expression for For example in the case just studied we saw that only other zerothorder states having or gave nonvanishing matrix elements In addition because contains energy denominators we may choose to limit our calculation to those other zerothorder states whose energies are close to our state of interest this assumes that such states will contribute a dominant amount to the sum You will encounter many times when reading literature articles in which perturbation theory is employed situations in which researchers have focused attention on zerothorder states that are close in energy to the state of interest and that have the correct symmetry to couple strongly ie have substantial to that state Electronelectron Coulomb repulsion In one of the most elementary pictures of atomic electronic structure one uses nuclear charge screening concepts to partially account for electronelectron interactions For example in ss Li one might posit a zerothorder wave function consisting of a product in which two electrons occupy a orbital and one electron occupies a orbital To find a reasonable form for the radial parts of these two orbitals one could express each of them as a linear combination of i one orbital having hydrogenic form with a nuclear charge of and ii a second orbital of form but with a nuclear charge of to account for the screening of the nucleus by the two innershell electrons where the index i labels the and orbitals to be determined Next one could determine the and expansion coefficients by requiring the fi to be approximate eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian that would be appropriate for an electron attracted to the Li nucleus but not experiencing any repulsions with other electrons This would result in the following equation for the expansion coefficients leftbeginarraycc langle chi_sZr fracnablafracrchi_sZr rangle langle chi_sZr fracnablafracr chi_sZr rangle langle chi_sZr fracnablafracr chi_sZr

rangle langle chi_sZr chi_sZr rangle endarrayright leftbeginarrayccC Dendarrayright This x matrix eigenvalue problem can be solved for the and coefficients and for the energies of the and orbitals The lowerenergy solution will have and will be this models description of the orbital The higherenergy solution will have and is the approximation to the orbital Using these and orbitals and the electron wave function they form as a zerothorder approximation how do we then proceed to apply perturbation theory The full threeelectron Hamiltonian can be decomposed into a zerothorder part and a perturbation The zerothorder energy of the wave function is where each of the are the energies obtained by solving the x matrix eigenvalue equation shown earlier The firstorder energy of this state can be written as Elangle phi_sr_alphaphi_sr_betaphi_sr_alphaVphi_sr_alphaphi_sr_betaphi_sr_alpha rangle J_ssJ_ss with the Coulomb interaction integrals being defined as To carry out the electron integral appearing in one proceeds as follows For the integral one integrates over the spin variables using and and then integrates over the coordinate of the third electron using to obtain which is The two integrals arise when carrying out similar integration for the terms arising from and So through first order the energy of the Li atom at this level of treatment is given by The factor contains the contributions from the kinetic energy and electronnuclear Coulomb potential The terms describe the Coulombic repulsions among the three electrons Each of the Coulomb integrals can be interpreted as being equal to the Coulombic interaction between electrons one at location the other at averaged over the positions of these two electrons with their spatial probability distributions being given by and respectively Although the example just considered is rather primitive it introduces a point of view that characterizes one of the most commonly employed models for treating atomic and molecular electronic structure the HartreeFock HF meanfield model which we will discuss more in Chapter In the HF model one uses as a zerothorder Hamiltonian consisting of a sum of oneelectron terms containing the kinetic energy the Coulomb attraction to the nucleus I use the Li atom as an example here and a potential This potential which is written in terms of Coulomb integrals similar to those we discussed earlier as well as socalled exchange integrals that we will discuss in Chapter is designed to approximate the interaction of an electron at location with the other electrons in the atom or molecule Because is oneelectron additive its eigenfunctions consist of products of eigenfunctions of the operator offers an approximation to the true Coulomb interactions expressed in terms of a smearedout electron distribution interacting with the electron at ri Perturbation theory is then used to treat the effect of the perturbation on the zerothorder states We say that the perturbation often called the fluctuation potential corrects for the difference between the instantaneous Coulomb interactions among the electrons and the meanfield average interactions Contributors and
