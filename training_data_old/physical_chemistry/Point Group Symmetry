is assumed that the reader has previously learned how symmetry arises in molecular shapes and structures and what symmetry elements are eg planes axes of rotation centers of inversion etc We review and teach here only that material that is of direct application to symmetry analysis of molecular orbitals and vibrations and rotations of molecules We use a specific example the ammonia molecule to introduce and illustrate the important aspects of point group symmetry because this example contains most of the complexities that arise in any application of group theory to molecular problems Example The Symmetry Group of Ammonia The ammonia molecule belongs in its groundstate equilibrium geometry to the point group Its symmetry operations consist of two rotations rotations by and respectively about an axis passing through the nitrogen atom and lying perpendicular to the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms three vertical reflection operations and the identity operation Corresponding to these six operations are symmetry elements the threefold rotation axis and the three symmetry planes and that contain the three bonds and the axis see Figure Figure Ammonia Molecule and its Symmetry Elements These six symmetry operations form a mathematical group A group is defined as a set of objects satisfying four properties A combination rule is defined through which two group elements are combined to give a result that we call the product The product of two elements in the group must also be a member of the group ie the group is closed under the combination rule One special member of the group when combined with any other member of the group must leave the group member unchanged ie the group contains an identity element Every group member must have a reciprocal in the group When any group member is combined with its reciprocal the product is the identity element The associative law must hold when combining three group members ie ABC must equal ABC The members of symmetry groups are symmetry operations the combination rule is successive operation The identity element is the operation of doing nothing at all The group properties can be demonstrated by forming a multiplication table Let us label the rows of the table by the first operation and the columns by the second operation Note that this order is important because most groups are not commutative The group multiplication table is as follows beginarraycpcmpcmpcmpcmpcmpcmpcmpcmc EC_C_sigma_vsigma_vsigma_vtextSecond Operationhline C_C_C_Esigma_vsigma_vsigma_v

not move That is although we start with in the plane in and in if moves due to the first symmetry operation remains fixed and a different H atom lies in the plane Matrices as Group Representations In using symmetry to help simplify molecular orbital mo or vibrationrotation energylevel identifications the following strategy is followed A set of objects belonging to the constituent atoms or molecular fragments in a more general case is introduced These objects are the orbitals of the individual atoms or of the fragments in the mo case they are unit vectors along the Cartesian and directions located on each of the atoms and representing displacements along each of these directions in the vibrationrotation case Symmetry tools are used to combine these objects into new objects each of which belongs to a specific symmetry of the point group Because the Hamiltonian electronic in the mo case and vibrationrotation in the latter case commutes with the symmetry operations of the point group the matrix representation of H within the symmetryadapted basis will be block diagonal That is objects of different symmetry will not interact only interactions among those of the same symmetry need be considered To illustrate such symmetry adaptation consider symmetry adapting the orbital of and the three orbitals of the three H atoms We begin by determining how these orbitals transform under the symmetry operations of the point group The act of each of the six symmetry operations on the four atomic orbitals can be denoted as follows S_NS_S_S_ oversetErightarrow S_NS_S_S_ hphantomS_NS_S_S_ oversetC_rightarrow S_NS_S_S_ hphantomS_NS_S_S_ oversetC_rightarrow S_NS_S_S_ hphantomS_NS_S_S_ oversetsigma_vrightarrow S_NS_S_S_ hphantomS_NS_S_S_ oversetsigma_vrightarrow S_NS_S_S_ hphantomS_NS_S_S_ oversetsigma_vrightarrow S_NS_S_S_ Here we are using the active view that a rotation rotates the molecule by The equivalent passive view is that the basis functions are rotated In the rotation ends up where began ends up where began and ends up where began These transformations can be thought of in terms of a matrix multiplying a vector with elements For example if is the representation matrix giving the transformation then the above action of on the four basis orbitals can be expressed as DC_ leftbeginarraycS_NS_S_S_endarrayright leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright leftbeginarraycS_NS_S_S_endarrayright leftbeginarraycS_NS_S_S_endarrayright We can likewise write matrix representations for each of the symmetry operations of the point group DC_

leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright Dsigma_v Likewise we can verify that directly and we can notice that the matrices also show the same identity DC_Dsigma_v leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright leftbeginarraycccc endarrayright Dsigma_v In fact one finds that the six matrices when multiplied together in all possible ways obey the same multiplication table as did the six symmetry operations We say the matrices form a representation of the group because the matrices have all the properties of the group Characters of Representations One important property of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements which is called the trace of the matrix and is denoted So is called the trace or character of the matrix In the above example The importance of the characters of the symmetry operations lies in the fact that they do not depend on the specific basis used to form the matrix That is they are invariant to a unitary or orthogonal transformation of the objects used to define the matrices As a result they contain information about the symmetry operation itself and about the space spanned by the set of objects The significance of this observation for our symmetry adaptation process will become clear later Note that the characters of both rotations are the same as are the characters of all three reflections Collections of operations having identical characters are called classes Each operation in a class of operations has the same character as other members of the class The character of a class depends on the space spanned by the basis of functions on which the symmetry operations act Another Basis and Another Representation Above we used as a basis If alternatively we use the onedimensional basis consisting of the orbital on the Natom we obtain different characters as we now demonstrate The act of the six symmetry operations on this can be represented as follows S_N oversetErightarrow S_N hspacept S_N oversetC_rightarrow S_N hspacept S_N oversetC_rightarrow S_N We can represent this group of operations in this basis by the onedimensional set of matrices D E hspacept DC_ hspacept DC_ D sigma_v hspacept Dsigma_v hspacept Dsigma_v Again we have These six x matrices form another representation of the group In this basis each character is equal to unity The representation formed by allowing the six symmetry operations to act on the Natom orbital is clearly not the same as that formed when the same six operations acted on the basis We now need to learn how to further analyze the information content of a specific representation of the group formed when the symmetry operations act on any specific set of objects Reducible and Irreducible Representations Reducible Representations Note that every matrix in the four dimensional group representation labeled has the socalled block diagonal form beginarraycccchline hline A B C D E F G H I hline endarray This means that these matrices are really a combination of two separate group representations mathematically it is called a direct sum representation We say that is reducible into a onedimensional representation and a threedimensional representation formed by the x submatrices that we will call DE leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright hspacept DC_ leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright hspacept DC_ leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright Dsigma_v leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright hspacept Dsigma_v leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright hspacept Dsigma_v leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright The characters of are Note that we would have obtained this representation directly if we had originally chosen to examine the basis alone also note that these characters are equal to those of minus those of A Change in Basis Now let us convert to a new basis that is a linear combination of the original basis Dont worry about how I constructed and yet As will be demonstrated later we form them by using symmetry projection operators defined below We determine how the basis functions behave under the group operations by allowing the operations to act on the and interpreting the results in terms of the In particular So the matrix representations in the new basis are DE leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright hspacept DC_ leftbeginarrayccc frac frac frac frac endarrayright DC_ leftbeginarrayccc frac frac frac frac endarrayright hspacept Dsigma_v leftbeginarrayccc endarrayright Dsigma_v leftbeginarrayccc frac frac frac frac endarrayright hspacept Dsigma_v leftbeginarrayccc frac frac frac frac endarrayright Reduction of the Reducible Representation These six matrices can be verified to multiply just as the symmetry operations do thus they form another threedimensional representation of the group We see that in the basis the matrices are block diagonal This means that the space spanned by the functions which is the same space as the span forms a reducible representation that can be decomposed into a one dimensional space and a two dimensional space via formation of the functions Note that the characters traces of the matrices are not changed by the change in bases The onedimensional part of the above reducible threedimensional representation is seen to be the same as the totally symmetric representation we arrived at before The twodimensional representation that is left can be shown to be irreducible it has the following matrix representations DE leftbeginarraycc endarrayright hspacept DC_ leftbeginarraycc frac frac frac frac endarrayright hspacept DC_ leftbeginarraycc frac frac frac frac endarrayright Dsigma_v leftbeginarraycc endarrayright hspacept Dsigma_v leftbeginarraycc frac frac frac frac endarrayright hspacept Dsigma_v leftbeginarraycc frac frac frac frac endarrayright The characters can be obtained by summing diagonal elements Rotations as a Basis Another onedimensional representation of the group can be obtained by taking rotation about the Zaxis the axis as the object on which the symmetry operations act In writing these relations we use the fact that reflection reverses the sense of a rotation The matrix representations corresponding to this onedimensional basis are DE hspacept DC_ hspacept DC_ Dsigma_v hspacept Dsigma_v hspacept D sigma_v These onedimensional matrices can be shown to multiply together just like the symmetry operations of the group They form an irreducible representation of the group because it is onedimensional it cannot be further reduced Note that this onedimensional representation is not identical to that found above for the Natom orbital or the function Overview We have found three distinct irreducible representations for the symmetry group two different onedimensional and one two dimensional representations Are there any more An important theorem of group theory shows that the number of irreducible representations of a group is equal to the number of classes Since there are three classes of operation ie E and we have found all the irreducible representations of the point group There are no more The irreducible representations have standard names the first that arising from the and orbitals is called the arising from is called and is called not to be confused with the identity operation E We will see shortly where to find and identify these names Thus our original representation was a combination of two representations and one representation We say that is a direct sum representation A consequence is that the characters of the combination representation can be obtained by adding the characters of its constituent irreducible representations beginarraycccc E C_ sigma_v A_ A_ E hline A_ oplus E endarray How to Decompose Reducible Representations in General Suppose you were given only the characters How can you find out how many times and appear when you reduce to its irreducible parts You want to find a linear combination of the characters of and that add up You can treat the characters of matrices as vectors and take the dot product of with leftbeginarraycccccc E C_ C_ sigma_v sigma_v sigma_v endarrayright leftbeginarraycc E C_ C_ sigma_v sigma_v sigma_v endarrayright The vector is not normalized hence to obtain the component of along a unit vector in the direction one must divide by the norm of this norm is The result is that the reducible representation contains components Analogous projections in the and directions give components of and respectively In general to determine the number of times irreducible representation appears in the reducible representation with characters one calculates where is the order of the group ie the number of operations in the group six in our example and are the characters of the irreducible representation Commonly Used Bases We could take any set of functions as a basis for a group representation Commonly used sets include Cartesian displacement coordinates located on the atoms of a polyatomic molecule their symmetry treatment is equivalent to that involved in treating a set of p orbitals on the same atoms quadratic functions such as d orbitals as well as rotations about the and axes The transformation properties of these very commonly used bases are listed in the character tables shown in Section Summary The basic idea of symmetry analysis is that any basis of orbitals displacements rotations etc transforms either as one of the irreducible representations or as a direct sum reducible representation Symmetry tools are used to first determine how the basis transforms under action of the symmetry operations They are then used to decompose the resultant representations into their irreducible components More Examples The p Orbitals of Nitrogen For a function to transform according to a specific irreducible representation means that the function when operated upon by a pointgroup symmetry operator yields a linear combination of the functions that transform according to that irreducible representation For example a orbital is the axis of on the nitrogen atom belongs to the representation because it yields unity times itself when or the identity operation act on it The factor of means that has symmetry since the characters the numbers listed opposite and below and in the character table shown in Section of all six symmetry operations are for the irreducible representation The and orbitals on the nitrogen atom transform as the representation since and the identity operation map and among one another Specifically C_ leftbeginarraycp_x p_y

indicate how each symmetry operation maps and into some combinations of and are the representation matrices for that particular operation and for this particular irreducible representation IR For example leftbeginarraycc frac fracsqrt fracsqrt frac endarrayright DEsigma_v This set of matrices have the same characters as the matrices obtained earlier when the displacement vectors were analyzed but the individual matrix elements are different because we used a different basis set here and above it was and This illustrates the invariance of the trace to the specific representation the trace only depends on the space spanned not on the specific manner in which it is spanned A ShortCut A shortcut device exists for evaluating the trace of such representation matrices that is for computing the characters The diagonal elements of the representation matrices are the projections along each orbital of the effect of the symmetry operation acting on that orbital For example a diagonal element of the matrix is the component of along the direction More rigorously it is Thus the character of the matrix is the sum of and In general the character of any symmetry operation can be computed by allowing to operate on each orbital then projecting along ie forming and summing these terms If these rules are applied to the and orbitals of nitrogen within the point group one obtains This set of characters is the same as above and agrees with those of the representation for the point group Hence and belong to or transform as the representation This is why is to the right of the row of characters for the representation in the character table shown in Section In similar fashion the character table please refer to this table now states that and orbitals on nitrogen transform as E as do and but transforms as Earlier we considered in some detail how the three orbitals on the hydrogen atoms transform Repeating this analysis using the shortcut rule just described the traces characters of the x representation matrices are computed by allowing and to operate on and and then computing the component of the resulting function along the original function The resulting characters are and in agreement with what we calculated before Using the orthogonality of characters taken as vectors we can reduce the above set of characters to Hence we say that our orbital set of three orbitals forms a reducible representation consisting of the sum of and IRs This means that the three orbitals can be combined to yield one orbital of symmetry and a pair that transform according to the representation Projector Operators Symmetry Adapted Linear Combinations of Atomic Orbitals To generate the above and symmetryadapted orbitals we make use of socalled symmetry projection operators and These operators are given in terms of linear combinations of products of characters times elementary symmetry operations as follows where ranges over and and the identity operation The result of applying to say is P_A_ s_H_ s_H_ s_H_s_H_s_H_s_H_s_H_ s_H_s_H_s_H_ phi_A_ which is an unnormalized orbital having symmetry Clearly this same orbital would be generated by acting on or Hence only one orbital exists Likewise which is one of the symmetry adapted orbitals having symmetry The other orbital can be obtained by allowing to act on or It might seem as though three orbitals having symmetry were generated but only two of these are really independent functions For example is related to and as follows Thus only and are needed to span the twodimensional space of the representation If we include in our set of orbitals and require our orbitals to be orthogonal then we must find numbers and such that is orthogonal to A straightforward calculation gives or which agrees with what we used earlier to construct the functions in terms of the functions Summary Let us now summarize what we have learned thus far about point group symmetry Any given set of atomic orbitals atomcentered displacements or rotations can be used as a basis for the symmetry operations of the point group of the molecule The characters belonging to the operations of this point group within any such space can be found by summing the integrals over all the atomic orbitals or corresponding unit vector atomic displacements or rotations The resultant characters will in general be reducible to a combination of the characters of the irreducible representations To decompose the characters of the reducible representation to a sum of characters of the irreducible representation it is necessary to determine how many times the irreducible representation occurs in the reducible representation The expression for is in which is the order of the point group the total number of symmetry operations in the group eg for For example the reducible representation and formed by the three orbitals discussed above can be decomposed as follows These equations state that the three orbitals can be combined to give one orbital and since is degenerate one pair of orbitals as established above With knowledge of the the symmetryadapted orbitals can be formed by allowing the projectors to operate on each of the primitive atomic orbitals How this is carried out was illustrated for the orbitals in our earlier discussion These tools allow a symmetry decomposition of any set of atomic orbitals into appropriate symmetryadapted orbitals Before considering other concepts and grouptheoretical machinery it should once again be stressed that these same tools can be used in symmetry analysis of the translational vibrational and rotational motions of a molecule The twelve motions of three translations three rotations six vibrations can be described in terms of combinations of displacements of each of the four atoms in each of three directions Hence unit vectors placed on each atom directed in the and directions form a basis for action by the operations of the point group In the case of the characters of the resultant x representation matrices form a reducible representation in the point group For example under the and atoms are interchanged so unit vectors on either one will not contribute to the trace Unit zvectors on and remain unchanged as well as the corresponding yvectors However the xvectors on and are reversed in sign The total character for the and atoms are interchanged so unit vectors on either one will not contribute to the trace Unit zvectors on and remain unchanged as well as the corresponding yvectors However the xvectors on and are reversed in sign The total character for is thus This representation can be decomposed as follows From the information on the right side of the character table translations of all four atoms in the and directions transform as and respectively whereas rotations about the and axes transform as and E Hence of the twelve motions three translations have and symmetry and three rotations have and symmetry This leaves six vibrations of which two have symmetry none have symmetry and two pairs have symmetry We could obtain symmetryadapted vibrational and rotational bases by allowing symmetry projection operators of the irreducible representation symmetries to operate on various elementary Cartesian atomic displacement vectors centered on the four atoms Direct Product Representations Direct Products in NElectron Wave functions We now turn to the symmetry analysis of orbital products Such knowledge is important because one is routinely faced with constructing symmetryadapted electron configurations that consist of products of individual spin orbitals one for each electron A pointgroup symmetry operator S when acting on such a product of orbitals gives the product of acting on each of the individual orbitals For example reflection of an orbital product through the plane in applies the reflection operation to all electrons Just as the individual orbitals formed a basis for action of the pointgroup operators the configurations orbital products form a basis for the action of these same pointgroup operators Hence the various electronic configurations can be treated as functions on which operates and the machinery illustrated earlier for decomposing orbital symmetry can then be used to carry out a symmetry analysis of configurations Another shortcut makes this task easier Since the symmetry adapted individual orbitals transform according to irreducible representations the representation matrices for the term products shown above consist of products of the matrices belonging to each This matrix product is not a simple product but what is called a direct product To compute the characters of the direct product matrices one multiplies the characters of the individual matrices of the irreducible representations of the orbitals that appear in the electron configuration The directproduct representation formed by the orbital products can therefore be symmetryanalyzed reduced using the same tools as we used earlier For example if one is interested in knowing the symmetry of an orbital product of the form note lower case letters are used to denote the symmetry of electronic orbitals whereas capital letters are reserved to label the overall configurations symmetry in symmetry the following procedure is used For each of the six symmetry operations in the point group the product of the characters associated with each of the six spin orbitals orbital multiplied by á or â spin is formed In the specific case considered here and Notice that the contributions of any doubly occupied nondegenerate orbitals eg and to these direct product characters are unity because for all operators for any onedimensional irreducible representation As a result only the singly occupied or degenerate orbitals need to be considered when forming the characters of the reducible directproduct representation For this example this means that the directproduct characters can be determined from the characters of the two active ie nonclosedshell orbitals the orbitals That is From the directproduct characters belonging to a particular electronic configuration eg one must still decompose this list of characters into a sum of irreducible characters For the example at hand the directproduct characters decompose into one one and one representation This means that the configuration contains and symmetry elements Projection operators analogous to those introduced earlier for orbitals can be used to form symmetryadapted orbital products from the individual basis orbital products of the form where and denote the occupation or of the two degenerate orbitals and In Appendix III of Electronic Spectra and Electronic Structure of Polyatomic Molecules G Herzberg Van Nostrand Reinhold Co New York NY the resolution of direct products among various representations within many point groups are tabulated When dealing with indistinguishable particles such as electrons it is also necessary to further project the resulting orbital products to make them antisymmetric for Fermions or symmetric for Bosons with respect to interchange of any pair of particles This step reduces the set of electron states that can arise For example in the above configuration case only and states arise the and possibilities disappear when the antisymmetry projector is applied In contrast for an configuration all states arise even after the wave function has been made antisymmetric The steps involved in combining the point group symmetry with permutational antisymmetry are illustrated in Chapter of this text as well as in Chapter of my QMIC text Direct Products in Selection Rules Two states and that are eigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian in the absence of some external perturbation eg electromagnetic field or static electric field or potential due to surrounding ligands can be coupled by the perturbation only if the symmetries of and of the two wave functions obey a socalled selection rule In particular only if the coupling integral is nonvanishing will the two states be coupled by The role of symmetry in determining whether such integrals are nonzero can be demonstrated by noting that the integrand considered as a whole must contain a component that is invariant under all of the group operations ie belongs to the totally symmetric representation of the group if the integral is to not vanish In terms of the projectors introduced above we must have not vanish Here the subscript denotes the totally symmetric representation of whatever point group applies The symmetry of the product is according to what was covered earlier given by the direct product of the symmetries of of and of So the conclusion is that the integral will vanish unless this triple direct product contains when it is reduced to its irreducible components a component of the totally symmetric representation Another way to state the above result and a way this is more often used in practice is that the integral will vanish unless the symmetry of the direct product matches the symmetry of Only when these symmetries match will the triple direct product contain a nonzero component of the totally symmetric representation This is very much the same as what we saw earlier in this Chapter when we discussed how angular momentum coupling could limit which states contribute to the secondorder perturbation theory energy The angular momenta of and of when coupled must have a component that matches the angular momentum of To see how this result is used consider the integral that arises in formulating the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with a molecule within the electricdipole approximation Here is the vector giving together with the unit charge the quantum mechanical dipole moment operator where and are the charge and position of the nth nucleus and is the position of the jth electron Now consider evaluating this integral for the singlet transition in formaldehyde Here the closedshell ground state is of symmetry and the singlet excited state which involves promoting an electron from the nonbonding lone pair orbital on the Oxygen atom into the antibonding orbital on the CO moiety is of symmetry The direct product of the two wave function symmetries thus contains only symmetry The three components and of the dipole operator have respectively and symmetry Thus the triple direct products give rise to the following possibilities There is no component of symmetry in the triple direct product so the integral vanishes The alternative way of reaching this same conclusion is to notice that the direct product of the symmetries of the orbital and the lone pair orbital is which does not match the symmetry of any component of the dipole operator Either route allows us to conclude that the excitation in formaldehyde is electric dipole forbidden Overview We have shown how to make a symmetry decomposition of a basis of atomic orbitals or Cartesian displacements or orbital products into irreducible representation components This tool is very helpful when studying spectroscopy and when constructing the orbital correlation diagrams that form the basis of the WoodwardHoffmann rules that play useful roles in predicting whether chemical reactions will have energy barriers in excess of thermodynamic barriers We also learned how to form the directproduct symmetries that arise when considering configurations consisting of products of symmetryadapted spin orbitals Finally we learned how the direct product analysis allows one to determine whether or not integrals of products of wave functions with operators between them vanish This tool is of utmost importance in determining selection rules in spectroscopy and for determining the effects of external perturbations on the states of the species under investigation Contributors and Attributions Jack Simons Henry Eyring Scientist and Professor of Chemistry U Utah Telluride
