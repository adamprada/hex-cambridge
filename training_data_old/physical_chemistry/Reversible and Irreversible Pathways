Volume PathwaysConstant Pressure PathwaysAdiabatic PathwaysContributors and Attributions The most common example of work in the systems discussed in this book is the work of expansion It is also convenient to use the work of expansion to exemplify the difference between work that is done reversibly and that which is done irreversibly The example of expansion against a constant external pressure is an example of an irreversible pathway It does not mean that the gas cannot be recompressed It does however mean that there is a definite direction of spontaneous change at all points along the expansion Imagine instead a case where the expansion has no spontaneous direction of change as there is no net force push the gas to seek a larger or smaller volume The only way this is possible is if the pressure of the expanding gas is the same as the external pressure resisting the expansion at all points along the expansion With no net force pushing the change in one direction or the other the change is said to be reversible or to occur reversibly The work of a reversible expansion of an ideal gas is fairly easy to calculate If the gas expands reversibly the external pressure can be replaced by a single value which represents both the pressure of the gas and the external pressure or But now that the external pressure is not constant cannot be extracted from the integral Fortunately however there is a simple relationship that tells us how changes with changing the equation of state If the gas is assumed to be an ideal gas And if the temperature is held constant so that the expansion follows an isothermal pathway the nRT term can be extracted from the integral Equation refisothermal is derived for ideal gases only a van der Waal gas would result in a different version Example Gas Expansion What is the work done by mol an ideal gas expanding reversibly from a volume of L to a volume of L at a constant temperature of K Solution Using Equation refisothermal to calculate this Note A reversible expansion will always require more work than an irreversible expansion such as an expansion against a constant external pressure when the final states of the two expansions are the same The work of expansion can be depicted graphically as the area under the pV curve depicting the expansion Comparing examples and for which the initial and final volumes were the same and the constant external pressure of the irreversible expansion was the same as the final pressure of the reversible expansion such a graph looks as follows The work is depicted as the shaded portion of the graph It is clear to see that the reversible expansion the work for which is shaded in both light and dark gray exceeds that of the irreversible expansion shaded in dark gray only due to the changing pressure of the reversible expansion In general it will always be the case that the work generated by a reversible pathway connecting initial and final states will be the maximum work possible for the expansion It should be noted although it will be proven in a later chapter that for an isothermal reversible process involving only pV work is for an ideal gas This is true because the internal energy U is a measure of a systems capacity to convert energy into work In order to do this the system must somehow store that energy The only mode in which an ideal gas can store this energy is in the translational kinetic energy of the molecules otherwise molecular collisions would not need to be elastic which as you recall was a postulate of the kinetic molecular theory And since the average kinetic energy is a function only of the temperature it and therefore can only change if there is a change in temperature Hence for any isothermal process for an ideal gas And perhaps just as usefully for an isothermal process involving an ideal gas as any energy that is expended by doing work must be replaced with heat lest the system temperature drop Constant Volume Pathways One common pathway which processes can follow is that of constant volume This will happen if the volume of a sample is constrained by a great enough force that it simply cannot change It is not uncommon to encounter such conditions with gases since they are highly compressible anyhow and also in geological formations where the tremendous weight of a large mountain may force any processes occurring under it to happen at constant volume If reversible changes in which the only work that can be done is that of expansion socalled pV work are considered the following important result is obtained However since the volume is constant As such can be expressed only in terms of the heat that flows into or out of the system at constant volume Recall that can be found by This suggests an important definition for the constant volume heat capacity which is When Equation refeq is integrated the Example Isochoric Pathway Consider mol of an ideal gas with that undergoes a temperature change from K to K at a constant volume of L Calculate and for this change Solution Since this is a constant volume process Equation refisochoric is applicable for an isochoric process Assuming is independent of temperature Since this a constant volume pathway Constant Pressure Pathways Most laboratorybased chemistry occurs at constant pressure Specifically it is exposed to the constant air pressure of the laboratory glove box or other container in which reactions are taking place For constant pressure changes it is convenient to define a new thermodynamic quantity called enthalpy or For reversible changes at constant pressure for which only pV work is done And just as in the case of constant volume changes this implies an important definition for the constant pressure heat capacity Example Isobaric Gas Expansion Consider mol of an ideal gas with that changes temperature change from K to K at a constant pressure of atm Calculate and for this change Solution assuming is independent of temperature So via Equation refheat specifically the integrated version of it using differences instead of differentials Now that and are determined then work can be calculated It makes sense that is negative since this process is an gas expansion Example Isothermal Gas Expansion Calculate and for mol of an ideal gas expanding reversibly and isothermally at K from a volume of L and a pressure of atm to a volume of L and a pressure of atm Solution Since this is an isothermal expansion Equationrefisothermal is applicable Since this is an isothermal expansion where due to Boyles Law Adiabatic Pathways An adiabatic pathway is defined as one in which no heat is transferred Under these circumstances if an ideal gas expands it is doing work against the surroundings provided the external pressure is not zero and as such the internal energy must drop And since is negative there must also be a decrease in the temperature How big will the decrease in temperature be and on what will it depend The key to answering these questions comes in the solution to how we calculate the work done If the adiabatic expansion is reversible and done on an ideal gas and Equating these two terms yields Using the ideal gas law for an expression for And rearranging to gather the temperature terms on the right and volume terms on the left yields This expression can be integrated on the left between and and on the right between and Assuming that is independent of temperature over the range of integration it can be pulled from the integrand in the term on the right The result is or or or Once is known it is easy to calculate and Example mol of an ideal gas CV R initially occupies L at K The gas expands adiabatically and reversibly to a final volume of L Calculate and for the expansion Solution Since the pathway is adiabatic Using Equation refEqAlternative So For calculating work we integrate Equation refAdiabate to get The following table shows recipes for calculating and for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible change along the specified pathway Table Thermodynamics Properties for a Reversible Expansion or Compression Pathway Isothermal Isochoric Isobaric adiabatic
