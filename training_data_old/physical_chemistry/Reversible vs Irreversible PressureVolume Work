consider heat transfer in reversible processes Similar considerations apply to the exchange of work between a system and its surroundings When we use a piston to compress a gas in a cylinder we must apply sufficient inward force on the piston to overcome the outward force applied by the gas In any real system it is necessary also to overcome the force of friction in order to slide the piston into the cylinder We ignore friction imagining that we can make its effects arbitrarily small The gas can be compressed only if the applied pressure exceeds the gas pressure If the applied pressure equals the gas pressure the piston remains stationary If the applied pressure is greater than the gas pressure by any eversosmall amount the gas will be compressed Conversely if the applied pressure is infinitesimally less than the gas pressure the gas will expand The work done under such conditions is reversible work an arbitrarily small change in the relative pressures can reverse the direction in which the piston moves We summarize these conditions by saying that reversible pressurevolume work can occur only if the system and its surroundings are at mechanical equilibrium Now let us think about calculating the reversible work for isothermally compressing a gas by sliding a piston into a cylinder In any real experiment we must have and any real experiment is necessarily irreversible In a reversible experiment we have and the reversible work is For one mole of an ideal gas we have Since the temperature is constant the reversible isothermal work becomes where and are the initial and final volumes of the gas respectively This has a straightforward graphical interpretation For an ideal gas at constant temperature is inversely proportional to As sketched in Figure the reversible work corresponds to the area between this curve and the abscissa and between the initial and the final gas volumes Figure Reversible versus irreversible expansion of an ideal gas In contrast an irreversible expansion corresponds to movement of the piston when or equivalently Therefore the work done on the gas is less in the reversible case than it is in the irreversible case Both work terms are less than zero The absolute value of the reversible work is greater than the absolute value of the irreversible work From our definitions of reversible and irreversible pressurevolume work we have and so long as the initial and final states are the same in the irreversible process as they are in the reversible constanttemperature process The shaded area in Figure represents the work done on the gas when the applied pressure is instantaneously decreased to the final pressure attained by the gas in the reversible process For the reversible process the pressurevolume curve accurately depicts the state of the gas as the volume increase takes place The temperature of the gas is constant along this curve While we can trace a similar line of pressurevolume points for the irreversible expansion this line does not define a set of intermediate states that the system occupies during the irreversible expansion The state of the gas is well defined only in the equilibrium state that precedes the irreversible pressure drop and in the equilibrium state that the system ultimately attains It is convenient to describe these two processes as a reversible process and a spontaneous process that take the system from the same initial state to the same final state However this language obscures a significant point In the initial state for the reversible process we have In the initial state for the spontaneous process we have and What we mean of course is that the values of all of the state functions for the hypothetical initial state of the spontaneous process are the same as those for the equilibrium initial state of the reversible process So long as we can say that the process takes the system from the same initial state to the same final state a similar argument can be made for reversible and irreversible work of any kind Whatever the force the isothermal reversible work done on the system is always less than the irreversible work for taking the system between the same two states This is an important result In Chapter we find that it is a logical consequence of the second law of thermodynamics Finally let us consider a reversible process in which a system completes a pressurevolume cycle The system traverses a closed path in the pressurevolume plane Such a path is depicted in Figure We let the smallest and largest volumes reached during the cycle be and respectively The closed path is composed of a highpressure segment and a lowpressure segment that meet at and On each of these segments the pressure is a function of volume We let pressures on the high and lowpressure segments be and respectively In the interval we have At the limiting volumes we have and The system temperature varies continuously around the closed path The work done on the system as it traverses the highpressure segment from to is represented in Figure by area Figure Reversible pressurevolume work in a cycle We have The work done on the system as it traverses the lowpressure segment from to is represented by area We have When the lowpressure segment is traversed in the opposite direction we have When the system traverses the cycle in the counterclockwise direction the net work done on the system is Thus the net work done on the system is represented on the graph by the area which is just the negative area in the pressurevolume plane that is bounded by the closed path
