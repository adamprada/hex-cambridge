Temperature and the Ideal Gas Thermometer Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers In Section we suppose that we have a thermometer that we can use to measure the temperature of a gas We suppose that this thermometer uses a liquid and we define an increase in temperature by the increase in the volume of this liquid Our statement of Charles law asserts that the volume of a gas is a linear function of the volume of the liquid in our thermometer and that the same linear function is observed for any gas As we note in Section there is a problem with this statement Careful experiments with such thermometers produce results that deviate from Charles law With sufficiently accurate volume measurements this occurs to some extent for any choice of the liquid in the thermometer If we make sufficiently accurate measurements the volume of a gas is not exactly proportional to the volume of any liquid or solid that we might choose as the working substance in our thermometer That is if we base our temperature scale on a liquid or solid substance we observe deviations from Charles law There is a further difficulty with using a liquid as the standard fluid on which to base our temperature measurements temperatures outside the liquid range of the chosen substance have to be measured in some other way Evidently we can choose to use a gas as the working fluid in our thermometer That is our gasvolume measuring device is itself a thermometer This fact proves to be very useful because of a further experimental observation To a very good approximation we find If we keep the pressures in the thermometer and in some other gaseous system constant at low enough values both gases behave as ideal gases and we find that the volumes of the two gases are proportional to each other over any range of temperature Moreover this proportionality is observed for any choice of either gas This means that we can define temperature in terms of the expansion of any constantpressure gas that behaves ideally In principle we can measure the same temperature using any gas so long as the constant operating pressure is low enough When we do so our device is called the ideal gas thermometer In so far as any gas behaves as an ideal gas at a sufficiently low pressure any real gas can be used in an ideal gas thermometer and to measure any temperature accurately Of course practical problems emerge when we attempt to make such measurements at very high and very low temperatures The very nearly direct proportionality of two lowpressure real gas volumes contrasts with what we observe for liquids and solids In general the volume of a given liquid or solid substance is not exactly proportional to the volume of a second liquid or solid substance over a wide range of temperatures In practice the idealgas thermometer is not as convenient to use as other thermometerslike the mercuryinglass thermometer However the idealgas thermometer is used to calibrate other thermometers Of course we have to calibrate the idealgas thermometer itself before we can use it We do this by assigning a temperature of K to the triple point of water It turns out that the melting point of ice isnt sufficiently reproducible for the most precise work Recall that the triple point is the temperature and pressure at which all three phases of water are at equilibrium with one another with no air or other substances present The triplepoint pressure is Pa or atm See Section From both theoretical considerations and experimental observations we are confident that no system can attain a temperature below absolute zero Thus the size of the kelvin one degree on the Kelvin scale is fixed by the difference in temperature between a system at the triple point of water and one at absolute zero If our ideal gas thermometer has volume at thermal equilibrium with some other constanttemperature system the proportionality of and means that With the triple point fixed at K experiments find the freezing point of airsaturated water to be K when the system pressure is atmosphere So the melting point of ice is K and the triplepoint is C We will find two reasons for the fact that the melting point is lower than the triple point In Section we find that the melting point of ice decreases as the pressure increases In Section we find that solutes usually decrease the temperature at which the liquid and solid states of a substance are in phase equilibrium If we could use an ideal gas in our idealgas thermometer we could be confident that we had a rigorous operational definition of temperature However we note in Section that any real gas will exhibit departures from ideal gas behavior if we make sufficiently accurate measurements For extremely accurate work we need a way to correct the temperature value that we associate with a given realgas volume The issue here is the value of the partial derivative For one mole of an ideal gas is a constant For a real gas it is a function of temperature Let us assume that we know this function Let the molar volume of the real gas at the triple point of water be and its volume at thermal equilibrium with a system whose true temperature is be We have When we know the integrand on the left as a function of temperature we can do the integration and find the temperature corresponding to any measured volume When the working fluid in our thermometer is a real gas we make measurements to find as a function of temperature Here we encounter a circularity To find from pressurevolumetemperature data we must have a way to measure temperature however this is the very thing that we are trying to find In principle we can surmount this difficulty by iteratively correcting the temperature that we associate with a given realgas volume As a first approximation we use the temperatures that we measure with an uncorrected realgas thermometer These temperatures are a first approximation to the idealgas temperature scale Using this scale we make nonpressurevolumetemperature measurements that establish as a function of temperature for the real gas This function is where is the constantpressure heat capacity and is the JouleThomson coefficient Both are functions of temperature We introduce in Section We discuss the JouleThomson coefficient further in Section below and in detail in Section Typically and the value of is well approximated by With established using this scale integration yields a secondapproximation to the idealgas temperatures We could repeat this process until successive temperature scales converge at the number of significant figures that our experimental accuracy can support In practice there are several kinds of idealgas thermometers and numerous corrections are required for very accurate measurements There are also numerous other ways to measure temperature each of which has its own complications Our development has considered some of the ideas that have given rise to the concept that temperature is fundamental property of nature that can be measured using a thermodynamictemperature scale on which values begin at zero and increase to arbitrarily high values This thermodynamic temperature scale is a creature of theory whose realworld counterpart would be the scale established by an idealgas thermometer whose gas actually obeyed at all conditions We have seen that such an idealgas thermometer is itself a creature of theory The current realworld standard temperature scale is the International Temperature Scale of ITS This defines temperature over a wide range in terms of the pressurevolume relationships of helium isotopes and the triple points of several selected elements The triple points fix the temperature at each of several conditions up to K the freezing point of copper Needless to say the temperatures assigned at the fixed points are the results of painstaking experiments designed to give the closest possible match to the thermodynamic scale A variety of measuring devicesthermometerscan be used to interpolate temperature values between different pairs of fixed points
