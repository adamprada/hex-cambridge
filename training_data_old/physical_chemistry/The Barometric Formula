The Barometric Formula Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers We can measure the pressure of the atmosphere at any location by using a barometer A mercury barometer is a sealed tube that contains a vertical column of liquid mercury The space in the tube above the liquid mercury is occupied by mercury vapor Since the vapor pressure of liquid mercury at ordinary temperatures is very low the pressure at the top of the mercury column is very low and can usually be ignored The pressure at the bottom of the column of mercury is equal to the pressure of a column of air extending from the elevation of the barometer all the way to the top of the earths atmosphere As we take the barometer to higher altitudes we find that the height of the mercury column decreases because less and less of the atmosphere is above the barometer Figure Atmospheric pressure versus altitude If we assume that the atmosphere is composed of an ideal gas and that its temperature is constant we can derive an equation for atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude Imagine a cylindrical column of air extending from the earths surface to the top of the atmosphere Figure The force exerted by this column at its base is the weight of the air in the column the pressure is this weight divided by the crosssectional area of the column Let the crosssectional area of the column be Consider a short section of this column Let the bottom of this section be a distance from the earths surface while its top is a distance from the earths surface The volume of this cylindrical section is then Let the mass of the gas in this section be The pressure at is less than the pressure at by the weight of this gas divided by the crosssectional area The weight of the gas is The pressure difference is We have Since we are assuming that the sample of gas in the cylindrical section behaves ideally we have Substituting for and taking the limit as we find where we introduce as the number of moles of gas in the sample as the molar mass of this gas and as the mass of an individual atmosphere molecule The last equality on the right makes use of the identities and Separating variables and integrating between limits and we find so that and Either of the latter relationships is frequently called the barometric formula If we let be the number of molecules per unit volume we can write and so that the barometric formula can be expressed in terms of these number densities as
