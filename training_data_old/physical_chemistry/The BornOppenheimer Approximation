Densities Time Propagation of Wave functionsContributors and Attributions One of the most important approximations relating to applying quantum mechanics to molecules and molecular ions is known as the BornOppenheimer BO approximation The basic idea behind this approximation involves realizing that in the full electronsplusnuclei Hamiltonian operator introduced above the time scales with which the electrons and nuclei move are usually quite different In particular the heavy nuclei ie even a H nucleus weighs nearly times what an electron weighs move ie vibrate and rotate more slowly than do the lighter electrons For example typical bond vibrational motions occur over time scales of ca s molecular rotations require times as long but electrons undergo periodic motions within their orbits on the s timescale if they reside within core or valence orbitals Thus we expect the electrons to be able to promptly adjust their motions to the much more slowly moving nuclei This observation motivates us to consider solving the Schrödinger equation for the movement of the electrons in the presence of fixed nuclei as a way to represent the fully adjusted state of the electrons at any fixed positions of the nuclei Of course we then have to have a way to describe the differences between how the electrons and nuclei behave in the absence of this approximation and how they move within the approximation These differences give rise to socalled nonBornOppenheimer corrections radiationless transitions surface hops and nonadiabatic transitions which we will deal with later It should be noted that this separation of time scales between fast electronic and slow vibration and rotation motions does not apply as well to for example Rydberg states of atoms and molecules As discussed earlier in such states the electron in the Rydberg orbital has much lower speed and much larger radial extent than for typical core or valence orbitals For this reason corrections to the BO model are usually more important to make when dealing with Rydberg states The electronic Hamiltonian that pertains to the motions of the electrons in the presence of clamped nuclei produces as its eigenvalues through the equation energies that depend on where the nuclei are located ie the coordinates As its eigenfunctions one obtains what are called electronic wave functions which also depend on where the nuclei are located The energies are what we usually call potential energy surfaces An example of such a surface is shown in Figure Figure Two dimensional potential energy surface showing local minima transition states and paths connecting them This surface depends on two geometrical coordinates and is a plot of one particular eigenvalue vs these two coordinates Although this plot has more information on it than we shall discuss now a few features are worth noting There appear to be three minima ie points where the derivative of with respect to both coordinates vanish and where the surface has positive curvature These points correspond as we will see toward the end of this introductory material to geometries of stable molecular structures The surface also displays two firstorder saddle points labeled transition structures A and B that connect the three minima These points have zero first derivative of with respect to both coordinates but have one direction of negative curvature As we will show later these points describe transition states that play crucial roles in the kinetics of transitions among the three stable geometries Keep in mind that Figure shows just one of the surfaces each molecule has a groundstate surface ie the one that is lowest in energy as well as an infinite number of excitedstate surfaces Lets now return to our discussion of the BO model and ask what one does once one has such an energy surface in hand The motion of the nuclei are subsequently within the BO model assumed to obey a Schrödinger equation in which defines a rotationvibration Hamiltonian for the particular energy state of interest The rotational and vibrational energies and wave functions belonging to each electronic state ie for each value of the index in are then found by solving a Hamiltonian This BO model forms the basis of much of how chemists view molecular structure and molecular spectroscopy For example as applied to formaldehyde we speak of the singlet ground electronic state with all electrons spin paired and occupying the lowest energy orbitals and its vibrational and rotational states as well as the and electronic states and their vibrational and rotational levels Although much more will be said about these concepts later in this text the student should be aware of the concepts of electronic energy surfaces ie the and the vibrationrotation states that belong to each such surface I should point out that the Cartesian coordinates used to describe the positions of the molecules nuclei can be replaced by Cartesian coordinates specifying the center of mass of the nuclei and other socalled internal coordinates that can be used to describe the molecules orientation these coordinates appear in the rotational kinetic energy and its bond lengths and angles these coordinates appear in the vibrational kinetic and potential energies When centerofmass and internal coordinates are used in place of the Cartesian coordinates the BornOppenheimer energy surfaces are seen to depend only on the internal coordinates Moreover if the molecules energy does not depend on its orientation eg if it is moving freely in the gas phase the will also not depend on the orientational coordinates but only on the vibrational coordinates Having been introduced to the concepts of operators wave functions the Hamiltonian and its Schrödinger equation it is important to now consider several examples of the applications of these concepts The examples treated below were chosen to provide the reader with valuable experience in solving the Schrödinger equation they were also chosen because they form the most elementary chemical models of electronic motions in conjugated molecules and in atoms rotations of linear molecules and vibrations of chemical bonds Your First Application of Quantum Mechanics Motion of a Particle in One Dimension This is a very important problem whose solutions chemists use to model a wide variety of phenomena Lets begin by examining the motion of a single particle of mass in one direction which we will call while under the influence of a potential denoted The classical expression for the total energy of such a system is where is the momentum of the particle along the xaxis To focus on specific examples consider how this particle would move if were of the forms shown in Figure where the total energy is denoted by the position of the horizontal line Figure Three characteristic potentials showing left and right classical turning points at energies denoted by the horizontal lines The Classical Probability Density I would like you to imagine what the probability density would be for this particle moving with total energy and with varying as the above three plots illustrate To conceptualize the probability density imagine the particle to have a blinking lamp attached to it and think of this lamp blinking say times for each time it takes for the particle to complete a full transit from its left turning point to its right turning point and back to the former The turning points and are the positions at which the particle if it were moving under Newtons laws would reverse direction as the momentum changes sign and turn around These positions can be found by asking where the momentum goes to zero These are the positions where all of the energy appears as potential energy and correspond in the above figures to the points where the dark horizontal lines touch the plots as shown in the central plot The probability density at any value of represents the fraction of time the particle spends at this value of ie within and Think of forming this density by allowing the blinking lamp attached to the particle to shed light on a photographic plate that is exposed to this light for many oscillations of the particle between and Alternatively one can express the probability that the particle spends between and by dividing the spatial distance by the velocity pm of the particle at the point Because is constant throughout the particles motion will be small at values where the particle is moving quickly ie where is low and will be high where the particle moves slowly where is high So the photographic plate will show a bright region where is high because the particle moves slowly in such regions and less brightness where is low Note however that as approaches the classical turning points the velocity approaches zero so the above expression for will approach infinity It does not mean the probability of finding the particle at the turning point is infinite it means that the probability density is infinite there This divergence of is a characteristic of the classical probability density that will be seen to be very different from the quantum probability density The bottom line is that the probability densities anticipated by analyzing the classical Newtonian dynamics of this one particle would appear as the histogram plots shown in Figure illustrate Figure Classical probability plots for the three potentials shown Where the particle has high kinetic energy and thus lower it spends less time and is small Where the particle moves slowly it spends more time and is larger For the plot on the right is constant within the box so the speed is constant hence is constant for all values within this onedimensional box I ask that you keep these plots in mind because they are very different from what one finds when one solves the Schrödinger equation for this same problem Also please keep in mind that these plots represent what one expects if the particle were moving according to classical Newtonian dynamics which we know it is not Quantum Treatment To solve for the quantum mechanical wave functions and energies of this same kind of problem we first write the Hamiltonian operator as discussed above by replacing by We then try to find solutions to that obey certain conditions These conditions are related to the fact that is supposed to be the probability density for finding the particle between and To keep things as simple as possible lets focus on the box potential shown in the right side of Figure This potential expressed as a function of is for and for for between and The fact that is infinite for and for and that the total energy must be finite says that must vanish in these two regions for and for This condition means that the particle cannot access regions of space where the potential is infinite The second condition that we make use of is that must be continuous this means that the probability of the particle being at cannot be discontinuously related to the probability of it being at a nearby point It is also true that the spatial derivative must be continuous except at points where the potential has an infinite discontinuity like it does in the example shown on the right in Figure The continuity of relates to continuity of momentum recall is a momentum operator When a particle moves under for example one of the two potential shown on the left or middle of Figure the potential smoothly changes as kinetic and potential energy interchange during the periodic motion In contrast when moving under the potential on the right of Figure the potential undergoes a sudden change of direction when the particle hits either wall So even classically the particles momentum undergoes a discontinuity at such hardwall turning points These conditions of continuity of and its spatial first derivative and that must vanish in regions of space where the potential is extremely high were postulated by the pioneers of quantum mechanics so that the predictions of the quantum theory would be in line with experimental observations Energies and Wave functions The secondorder differential equation has two solutions because it is a second order equation in the region between and where and where is defined as Hence the most general solution is some combination of these two We could alternatively use and as the two independent solutions we do so later in Section to illustrate because and can be rewritten in terms of and that is they span exactly the same space The fact that must vanish at nb vanishes for because is infinite there and is continuous so it must vanish at the point means that the weighting amplitude of the term must vanish because at That is The amplitude of the term is not affected by the condition that vanish at since itself vanishes at So now we know that is really of the form The condition that also vanish at because it vanishes for where again is infinite has two possible implications Either or must be such that The option would lead to an answer that vanishes at all values of and thus a probability that vanishes everywhere This is unacceptable because it would imply that the particle is never observed anywhere The other possibility is that Lets explore this answer because it offers the first example of energy quantization that you have probably encountered As you know the sin function vanishes at integral multiples of Hence must be some multiple of lets call the integer and write using the definition of in the form Solving this equation for the energy we obtain This result says that the only energy values that are capable of giving a wave function that will obey the above conditions are these specific values In other words not all energy values are allowed in the sense that they can produce functions that are continuous and vanish in regions where is infinite If one uses an energy that is not one of the allowed values and substitutes this into the resultant function will not vanish at I hope the solution to this problem reminds you of the violin string that we discussed earlier Recall that the violin string being tied down at and at gave rise to quantization of the wavelength just as the conditions that be continuous at and gave energy quantization Substituting into gives The value of A can be found by remembering that is supposed to represent the probability density for finding the particle at Such probability densities are supposed to be normalized meaning that their integral over all values should amount to unity So we can find A by requiring that where the integral ranges from to Looking up the integral of and solving the above equation for the socalled normalization constant gives and so The values that can take on are the choice is unacceptable because it would produce a wave function that vanishes at all The full x and t dependent wave functions are then given as Notice that the spatial probability density is not dependent on time and is equal to because the complex exponential disappears when is formed This means that the probability of finding the particle at various values of is timeindependent Another thing I want you to notice is that unlike the classical dynamics case not all energy values are allowed In the Newtonian dynamics situation could be specified and the particles momentum at any value was then determined to within a sign In contrast in quantum mechanics one must determine by solving the Schrödinger equation what the allowed values of are These values are quantized meaning that they occur only for discrete values determined by a quantum number by the mass of the particle m and by characteristics of the potential in this case Probability Densities Lets now look at some of the wave functions and compare the probability densities that they represent to the classical probability densities discussed earlier The and wave functions are shown in the top of Figure The corresponding quantum probability densities are shown below the wave functions in two formats as plots and shaded plots that could relate to the flashing light way of monitoring the particles location that we discussed earlier Figure The two lowest wave functions and probability densities A more complete set of wave functions for ranging from to are shown in Figure Figure Seven lowest wave functions and energies Notice that as the quantum number increases the energy also increases quadratically with in this case and the number of nodes in also increases Also notice that the probability densities are very different from what we encountered earlier for the classical case For example look at the and densities and compare them to the classical density illustrated in Figure Figure Classical probability density for potential shown The classical density is easy to understand because we are familiar with classical dynamics In this case we say that is constant within the box because the fact that is constant causes the kinetic energy and hence the speed of the particle to remain constant and this is true for any energy In contrast the quantum wave functions plot is peaked in the middle of the box and falls to zero at the walls The density has two peaks one to the left of the box midpoint and one to the right a node at the box midpoint and falls to zero at the walls One thing that students often ask me is how does the particle get from being in the left peak to being in the right peak if it has zero chance of ever being at the midpoint where the node is The difficulty with this question is that it is posed in a terminology that asks for a classical dynamics answer That is by asking how does the particle get one is demanding an answer that involves describing its motion ie it moves from here at time to there at time Unfortunately quantum mechanics does not deal with issues such as a particles trajectory ie where it is at various times but only with its probability of being somewhere ie The next section will treat such paradoxical issues even further Classical and Quantum Probability Densities As just noted it is tempting for most beginning students of quantum mechanics to attempt to interpret the quantum behavior of a particle in classical terms However this adventure is full of danger and bound to fail because small light particles simply do not move according to Newtons laws To illustrate lets try to understand what kind of classical motion would be consistent with the or quantum plots shown in Figure However as I hope you anticipate this attempt at gaining classical understanding of a quantum result will not work in that it will lead to nonsensical results My point in leading you to attempt such a classical understanding is to teach you that classical and quantum results are simply different and that you must resist the urge to impose a classical understanding on quantum results at least until you understand under what circumstances classical and quantum results should or should not be comparable For the case in Figure we note that is highest at the box midpoint and vanishes at and In a classical mechanics world this would mean that the particle moves slowly near and more quickly near and Because the particles total energy must remain constant as it moves in regions where it moves slowly the potential it experiences must be high and where it moves quickly must be small This analysis nb based on classical concepts would lead us to conclude that the arises from the particle moving in a potential that is high near and low as approaches or L A similar analysis of the plot for would lead us to conclude that the particle for which this is the correct must experience a potential that is high midway between and high midway between and and low near and near and These conclusions are crazy because we know that the potential for which we solved the Schrödinger equation to generate both of the wave functions and both probability densities is constant between and That is we know the same applies to the particle moving in the and states whereas the classical motion analysis offered above suggests that is different for these two cases What is wrong with our attempt to understand the quantum plots The mistake we made was in attempting to apply the equations and concepts of classical dynamics to a plot that did not arise from classical motion simply put one cannot ask how the particle is moving ie what is its speed at various positions when the particle is undergoing quantum dynamics Most students when first experiencing quantum wave functions and quantum probabilities try to think of the particle moving in a classical way that is consistent with the quantum This attempt to retain a degree of classical understanding of the particles movement is almost always met with frustration as I illustrated with the above example and will illustrate later in other cases Continuing with this first example of how one solves the Schrödinger equation and how one thinks of the quantized values and wave functions let me offer a little more optimistic note than offered in the preceding discussion If we examine the plot shown in Figure for and think of the corresponding we note that the plot would look something like that shown in Figure Figure Quantum probability density for showing seven peaks and six nodes It would have seven maxima separated by six nodes If we were to plot for a very large value such as we would find a plot having maxima separated by nodes with the maxima separated approximately by distances of L Such a plot when viewed in a coarsegrained sense ie focusing with somewhat blurred vision on the positions and heights of the maxima looks very much like the classical plot in which is constant for all Another way to look at the difference between the lown and highn quantum probability distributions is reflected in the socalled local de Broglie wavelength It can be shown that the classical and quantum probabilities will be similar in regions of space where This inequality will be true when is much larger than which is consistent with the view that high quantum states behave classically but it will not hold when is only slightly above ie for lowenergy quantum states and for any quantum state near classical turning points or when is smaller than ie in classically forbidden regions In summary it is a general result of quantum mechanics that the quantum distributions for large quantum numbers take on the form of the classical for the same potential that was used to solve the Schrödinger equation except near turning points and in classically forbidden regions It is also true that at any specified energy classical and quantum results agree better when one is dealing with heavy particles than for light particles For example a given energy corresponds to a higher quantum number in the particleinabox formula for a heavier particle than for a lighter particle Hence heavier particles moving with a given energy have more classical probability distributions To gain perspective about this matter in the table shown below I give the energy levels in kcal mol for a particle whose mass is or times an electrons mass constrained to move within a onedimensional region of length in Bohr units denoted Å Energies kcal mol for various and combinations m me L a L a L a L a m me xn xn xn xn m me xn xn xn xn m me xn xn xn xn m me xn xn xn xn Clearly for electrons even when free to roam over nanometers eg or one does not need to access a very high quantum state to reach kcal mol of energy eg would be adequate for Recall it is high quantum states where one expects the classical and quantum spatial probability distribution to be similar So when treating electrons one is probably nearly always going to have to make use of quantum mechanics and one will not be able to rely on classical mechanics For light nuclei with masses near times the electrons mass if the particle is constrained to a small distance range eg again even low quantum states will have energies in excess of kcal mol Only when free to move over of to does kcal mol correspond to relatively large quantum numbers for which one expects nearclassical behavior The data shown in the above table can also be used to estimate when quantum behavior such as BoseEinstein condensation can be expected When constrained to particles in the amu mass range have translational energies in the cal mol range Realizing that cal mol K this means that translational temperatures near K would be needed to cause these particles to occupy their ground state In contrast particles with masses in the range of amu even when constrained to distances of ca Å require to exceed ca before having kcal mol of translational energy When constrained to Å kcal mol requires to exceed So heavy particles will even at low energies behave classically except if they are constrained to very short distances We will encounter this socalled quantumclassical correspondence principal again when we examine other model problems It is an important property of solutions to the Schrödinger equation because it is what allows us to bridge the gap between using the Schrödinger equation to treat small light particles and the Newton equations for macroscopic big heavy systems Time Propagation of Wave functions For a particle in a box system that exists in an eigenstate having an energy the timedependent wave function is that can be generated by applying the socalled time evolution operator to the wave function at where an explicit form for is The function has a spatial probability density that does not depend on time because since However it is possible to prepare systems even in real laboratory settings in states that are not single eigenstates we call such states superposition states For example consider a particle moving along the x axis within the box potential but in a state whose wave function at some initial time is This is a superposition of the and eigenstates The probability density associated with this function is The and components the superposition and the probability density at are shown in the first three panels of Figure Figure The and wave functions upper left their superposition upper right and the bottom left and timeevolved bottom right probability densities of the superposition It should be noted that the probability density associated with this superposition state is not symmetric about the midpoint even though the and component wave functions and densities are Such a density describes the particle localized more strongly in the largex region of the box than in the smallx region at Now lets consider the superposition wave function and its density at later times Applying the time evolution operator to generates this timeevolved function at time t The spatial probability density associated with this is At this function clearly reduces to that written earlier for Notice that as time evolves this density changes because of the factor it contains In particular note that as moves through a period of time the cos factor changes sign That is for the factor is for the cos factor is for it returns to The result of this timevariation in the cos factor is that changes in form from that shown in the bottom left panel of Figure to that shown in the bottom right panel at and then back to the form in the bottom left panel at One can interpret this time variation as describing the particles probability density not its classical position initially localized toward the right side of the box moving to the left and then back to the right Of course this time evolution will continue over more and more cycles as time evolves further This example illustrates once again the difficulty with attempting to localize particles that are being described by quantum wave functions For example a particle that is characterized by the eigenstate is more likely to be detected near than near or because the square of this function is large near A particle in the state is most likely to be found near and but not near or The issue of how the particle in the latter state moves from being near to is not something quantum mechanics deals with Quantum mechanics does not allow us to follow the particles trajectory which is what we need to know when we ask how it moves from one place to another Nevertheless superposition wave functions can offer to some extent the opportunity to follow the motion of the particle For example the superposition state written above as has a probability amplitude that changes with time as shown in Figure Moreover this amplitudes major peak does move from side to side within the box as time evolves So in this case we can say with what frequency the major peak moves back and forth In a sense this allows us to follow the particles movements but only to the extent that we are satisfied with ascribing its location to the position of the major peak in its probability distribution That is we can not really follow its precise location but we can follow the location of where it is very likely to be found However notice that the time it takes the particle to move from right to left is dependent upon the energy difference between the two states contributing to the superposition state not to the energy of either of these states which is very different from what would expect if the particle were moving classically These are important observation that I hope the student will keep fresh in mind They are also important ingredients in modern quantum dynamics in which localized wave packets which are similar to superposed eigenstates discussed above are used to detail the position and speed of a particles main probability density peak The above example illustrates how one timeevolves a wave function that is expressed as a linear combination ie superposition of eigenstates of the problem at hand There is a large amount of current effort in the theoretical chemistry community aimed at developing efficient approximations to the evolution operator that do not require to be explicitly written as a sum of eigenstates This is important because for most systems of direct relevance to molecules one can not solve for the eigenstates it is simply too difficult to do so You can find a significantly more detailed treatment of the researchlevel treatment of this subject in my Theory Page web site and my QMIC textbook However lets spend a little time on a brief introduction to what is involved The problem is to express where is some initial wave function but not an eigenstate in a manner that does not require one to first find the eigenstates of and to expand in terms of these eigenstates after which the desired function is written as The basic idea is to break the operator into its kinetic and potential energy components and to realize that the differential operators appear in only The importance of this observation lies in the fact that and do not commute which means that is not equal to nb recall that for two quantities to commute means that their order of appearance does not matter Why do they not commute Because contains second derivatives with respect to the coordinates q_j that depends on so for example is not equal to The fact that and do not commute is important because the most obvious attempt to approximate is to write this single exponential in terms of and However the identity is not fully valid as one can see by expanding all three of the above exponential factors as and noting that the two sides of the above equation only agree if one can assume that which as we noted is not true In most modern approaches to time propagation one divides the time interval into many ie of them small time slices One then expresses the evolution operator as a product of shorttime propagators the student should by now be familiar with the fact that and are operators so from now on I will no longer necessarily use bold lettering for these quantities If one can then develop an efficient means of propagating for a short time one can then do so over and over again times to achieve the desired fulltime propagation It can be shown that the exponential operator involving can better be approximated in terms of the and exponential operators as follows So if one can be satisfied with propagating for very short time intervals so that the term can be neglected one can indeed use as an approximation for the propagator It can also be shown that the socalled split shorttime expression provides an even more accurate representation of the shorttime propagator because expansions of the left and righthand sides agree to higher orders in To progress further one then expresses acting on in terms of the eigenfunctions of the kinetic energy operator Note that these eigenfunctions do not depend on the nature of the potential V so this step is valid for any and all potentials The eigenfunctions of are the momentum eigenfunctions that we discussed earlier and they obey the following orthogonality and completeness relations Writing as and using the above expression for gives Then inserting the explicit expressions for and in terms of gives Now allowing to act on produces The integral over above can be carried out analytically and gives So the final expression for the shorttime propagated wave function is which is the working equation one uses to compute knowing Notice that all one needs to know to apply this formula is the potential at each point in space One does not need to know any of the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian to apply this method This is especially attractive when dealing with very large molecules or molecules in condensed media where it is essentially impossible to determine any of the eigenstates and where the energy spacings between eigenstates is extremely small However one does have to use this formula over and over again to propagate the initial wave function through many small time steps to achieve full propagation for the desired time interval Because this type of time propagation technique is a very active area of research in the theory community it is likely to continue to be refined and improved Further discussion of it is beyond the scope of this book so I will not go further into this
