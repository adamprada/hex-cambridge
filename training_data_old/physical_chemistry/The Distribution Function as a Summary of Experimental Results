The Distribution Function as a Summary of Experimental Results Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers In Section we derive Boyles law from Newtons laws using the assumption that all gas molecules move at the same speed at a given temperature This is a poor assumption Individual gas molecules actually have a wide range of velocities In Chapter we derive the MaxwellBoltzmann distribution law for the distribution of molecular velocities This law gives the fraction of gas molecules having velocities in any range of velocities Before developing the MaxwellBoltzmann distribution law we need to develop some ideas about distribution functions Most of these ideas are mathematical We discuss them in a nonrigorous way focusing on understanding what they mean rather than on proving them The overriding idea is that we have a realworld source of data We call this source of data the distribution We can collect data from this source to whatever extent we please The datum that we collect is called the distributions random variable We call each possible value of the random variable an outcome The process of gathering a set of particular values of the random variable from a distribution is often called sampling or drawing a sample The set of values that is collected is called the sample The set of values that comprise the sample is often called the data In scientific applications the random variable is usually a number that results from making a measurement on a physical system Calling this process drawing a sample can be inappropriate Often we call the process of getting a value for the random variable doing an experiment doing a test or making a trial As we collect increasing amounts of data the accumulation quickly becomes unwieldy unless we can reduce it to a mathematical model We call the mathematical model we develop a distribution function because it is a function that expresses what we are able to learn about the data sourcethe distribution A distribution function is an equation that summarizes the results of many measurements it is a mathematical model for a realworld source of data Specifically it models the frequency of an event with which we obtain a particular outcome We usually believe that we can make our mathematical model behave as much like the realworld data source as we want if we use enough experimental data in developing it Often we talk about statistics By a statistic we mean any mathematical entity that we can calculate from data Broadly speaking a distribution function is a statistic because it is obtained by fitting a mathematical function to data that we collect Two other statistics are often used to characterize experimental data the mean and the variance The mean and variance are defined for any distribution We want to see how to estimate the mean and variance from a set of experimental data collected from a particular distribution We distinguish between discrete and continuous distributions A discrete distribution is a realworld source of data that can produce only particular data values A coin toss is a good example It can produce only two outcomesheads or tails A continuous distribution is a realworld source of data that can produce data values in a continuous range The speed of an automobile is a good example An automobile can have any speed within a rather wide range of speeds For this distribution the random variable is automobile speed Of course we can generate a discrete distribution by aggregating the results of sampling a continuous distribution if we lump all automobile speeds between mph and mph together we lose the detailed information about the speed of each automobile and retain only the total number of automobiles with speeds in this interval
