The Effect of Temperature on Reaction Rates Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers In practice rate constants vary in response to changes in several factors Indeed they are usually the same in two experiments only if we keep everything but the reagent concentrations the same Another way of saying this is that the rate law captures the dependence of reaction rate on concentrations while the dependence of reaction rate on any other variable appears as a dependence of rate constants on that variable Temperature usually has a big effect The experimentally observed dependence of rate constants on temperature can be expressed in a compact fashion Over small temperature ranges it can usually be expressed adequately by the Arrhenius equation where and are called the Arrhenius activation energy and the frequency factor or preexponential factor respectively The Arrhenius equation is an empirical relationship As we see below for our collisiontheory model theoretical treatments predict that the preexponential term A is weakly temperature dependent When we investigate reaction rates experimentally the temperature dependence of A is usually obscured by the uncertainties in the measured rate constants It is often said as a rough rule of thumb that the rate of a chemical reaction doubles if the temperature increases by K However this rule can fail spectacularly A reaction can even proceed more slowly at a higher temperature and there are multistep reactions for which this is observed
