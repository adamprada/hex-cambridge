The Expected Value of a Function of Several Variables and the Central Limit Theorem Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers We can extend the idea of an expected value to a function of multiple random variables Let U and V be distributions whose random variables are and respectively Let the probability density functions for these distributions be and In general these probability density functions are different functions that is and are different distributions Let be some function of these random variables The probability that an observation made on produces a value of in the range is and the probability that an observation made on produces a value of in the range is The probability that making one observation on each of these distributions produces a value of that lies in the range and a value of that lies in the range is In a straightforward generalization we define the expected value of as If is a sum of functions of independent variables we have If is a product of independent functions we have We can extend these conclusions to functions of the random variables of any number of distributions If is the random variable of distribution whose probability density function is the expected value of becomes and the expected value of becomes We are particularly interested in expected values for repeated trials made on the same distribution We consider distributions for which the outcome of one trial is independent of the outcome of any other trial The probability density function is the same for every trial so we have Let the values obtained for the random variable in a series of trials on the same distribution be For each trial we have If we consider the special case of repeated trials in which the functions are all the same function so that the expected value of becomes and the expected value of becomes Now let us consider independent trials on the same distribution and let Then the expected value of becomes By definition the average of repeated trials is so that the expected value of the mean of a distribution of an averageof repeated trials is This proves one element of the central limit theorem The mean of a distribution of averagesof values of a random variable drawn from a parent distribution is equal to the mean of the parent distribution The variance of these averagesof is sigma_Nleftlangle leftoverlineu_Nmu rightrightrangle leftlangle leftleftfracNsumN_iu_irightmu right rightrangle leftlangle leftleftfracNsumN_iu_irightfracNmu Nrightrightrangle fracN leftlangle leftleftsumN_iu_irightNmu rightrightrangle fracN leftlangle leftleftsumN_ileftu_imu rightrightright rightrangle fracN leftlangle sumN_ileftu_imu right rightrangle fracN leftlangle sumN_i leftu_imu rightsumN_ji leftu_jmu right right rangle fracNsumN_i leftlangle leftu_imu right rightrangle fracN leftlangle sumN_i leftu_imu right rightrangle leftlangle sumN_ji leftu_jmu right rightranglenonumber Where the last term is zero because and By definition so that we have This proves a second element of the central limit theorem The variance of an average of values of a random variable drawn from a parent distribution is equal to the variance of the parent distribution divided by
