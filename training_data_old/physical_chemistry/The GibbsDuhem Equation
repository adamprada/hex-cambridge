The GibbsDuhem Equation Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Patrick FlemingAssistant Professor Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University East Bay Contributors and Attributions For a system at equilibrium the GibbsDuhem equation must hold This relationship places a compositional constraint upon any changes in the chemical potential in a mixture at constant temperature and pressure for a given composition This result is easily derived when one considers that represents the partial molar Gibbs function for component And as with other partial molar quantities Taking the derivative of both sides yields But can also be expressed as Setting these two expressions equal to one another And after canceling terms one gets sum_i n_i d mu_i Vdp sdT labeleq For a system at constant temperature and pressure Substituting Equation refeq into refeq results in the GibbsDuhem equation Equation refeq This expression relates how the chemical potential can change for a given composition while the system maintains equilibrium So for a binary system consisting of components and the two most often studied compounds in all of chemistry Contributors and Attributions Patrick E Fleming Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry California State University East Bay
