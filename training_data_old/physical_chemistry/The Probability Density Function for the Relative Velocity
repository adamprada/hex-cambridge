The Probability Density Function for the Relative Velocity Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers From our development of the MaxwellBoltzmann probability density functions we can express the probability that the velocity components of particle lie in the intervals to to to while those of particle simultaneously lie in the intervals to to to as We want to express this probability using the relative velocity coordinates Since the velocity of the center of mass and the relative velocity are independent we might expect that the Jacobian of this transformation is just the product of the two individual Jacobians This turns out to be the case The Jacobian of the transformation is a sixbysix determinate It is messy but straightforward to show that it is equal to the product of two threebythree determinants and that the absolute value of this product is one Therefore we have We transform the probability density by substituting into the onedimensional probability density functions That is where the last expression specifies the probability density as a function of the relative velocity coordinates Next we make a further transformation of variables We convert the velocity of the center of mass and the relative velocity from Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates referred to the axis system The motion of the center of mass is most readily visualized in the original frame The relative motion is most readily visualized in the ParticleOne Centered Frame In the motion of particle is specified by and The motion of the center of mass is specified by and Since it is the relative motion that is actually of interest it might seem that we should refer the spherical coordinates to the frame This is an unnecessary distinction because all three coordinate frames are parallel to one another and and are the same vectors in all three frames Letting the Cartesian velocity components are expressed in spherical coordinates by The angles and are defined in the usual manner relative to the axis system The Jacobian of this transformation is a sixbysix determinate which can again be converted to the product of two threebythree determinates We find The probability that the components of the velocity of the center of mass lie in the intervals to to to while the components of the relative velocity lie in the intervals to to to becomes We are interested in the probability increment for the relative velocityrelative velocityprobability density function irrespective of the velocity of the center of mass To sum the contributions for all possible motions of the center of mass we integrate this expression over the possible ranges of and We have This is the same as the probability increment for a singleparticle velocityalbeit with replacing replacing replacing and replacing As in the singleparticle case we can obtain the probability increment for the scalar component of the relative velocity by integrating over all possible values of and We find In we find the most probable velocity the mean velocity and the rootmeansquare velocity for a gas whose particles have mass By identical arguments we obtain the most probable relative velocity the mean relative velocity and the rootmeansquare relative velocity To do so we can simply substitute for in the earlier results In particular the mean relative velocity is If particles and have the same mass the reduced mass becomes In this case we have We can arrive at this same conclusion by considering the relative motion of two particles that represents the average case As illustrated in Figure this occurs when the two particles have the same speed but are moving at degree angles to one another In this situation the length of the resultant vectorthe relative speed is just
