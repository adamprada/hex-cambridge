The Probabilitydensity Function for Gas Velocities in One Dimension Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers In Section we find a differential equation in the function Unlike the velocity which takes values from zero to infinity the component takes values from minus infinity to plus infinity The probability density at an infinite velocity in either direction is necessarily zero Therefore we cannot evaluate the integral of from to an arbitrary velocity However we know from Maxwells assumption that the probability density for must be independent of whether the molecule is traveling in the direction of the positive axis or the negative axis That is must be an even function the probability density function must be symmetric around Hence we can express relative to its fixed value at We integrate from to as goes from zero to an arbitrary velocity to find or The value of must be such as to make the integral of over all possible values of equal to unity That is we must have where we use the definite integral See Appendix D It follows that The onedimensional probabilitydensity function becomes Note that this is the normal distribution with and So is the variance of the normal onedimensional probabilitydensity function As noted above in Section we find that
