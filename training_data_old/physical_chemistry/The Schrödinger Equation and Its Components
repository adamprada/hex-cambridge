functions The Schrödinger Equation The TimeDependent Equation The TimeIndependent EquationContributors and Attributions It has been well established that electrons moving in atoms and molecules do not obey the classical Newton equations of motion People long ago tried to treat electronic motion classically and found that features observed clearly in experimental measurements simply were not consistent with such a treatment Attempts were made to supplement the classical equations with conditions that could be used to rationalize such observations For example early workers required that the angular momentum be allowed to assume only integer multiples of which is often abbreviated as which can be shown to be equivalent to the Bohr postulate However until scientists realized that a new set of laws those of quantum mechanics applied to light microscopic particles a wide gulf existed between laboratory observations of moleculelevel phenomena and the equations used to describe such behavior Quantum mechanics is cast in a language that is not familiar to most students of chemistry who are examining the subject for the first time Its mathematical content and how it relates to experimental measurements both require a great deal of effort to master With these thoughts in mind i have organized this material in a manner that first provides a brief introduction to the two primary constructs of quantum mechanics operators and wave functions that obey a Schrödinger equation Next I demonstrate the application of these constructs to several chemically relevant model problems By learning the solutions of the Schrödinger equation for a few model systems the student can better appreciate the treatment of the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics as well as their relation to experimental measurement for which the wave functions of the known model problems offer important interpretations Operators Each physically measurable quantity has a corresponding operator The eigenvalues of the operator tell the only values of the corresponding physical property that can be observed in an experimental probe of that property Some operators have a continuum of eigenvalues but others have only discrete quantized eigenvalues Any experimentally measurable physical quantity eg energy dipole moment orbital angular momentum spin angular momentum linear momentum kinetic energy has a classical mechanical expression in terms of the Cartesian positions and momenta of the particles that comprise the system of interest Each such classical expression is assigned a corresponding quantum mechanical operator formed by replacing the in the classical form by the differential operator and leaving the coordinates that appear in untouched If one is working with a classical quantity expressed in terms of curvilinear coordinates it is important that this quantity first be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates The replacement of the Cartesian momenta by can then be made and the resultant expression can be transformed back to the curvilinear coordinates if desired Example For example the classical kinetic energy of particles with masses moving in a potential field containing both quadratic and linear coordinatedependence can be written as The quantum mechanical operator associated with this is Such an operator would occur when for example one describes the sum of the kinetic energies of a collection of particles the first term in Eq plus the sum of Hookes Law parabolic potentials the second term in Eq and the interactions of the particles with an externally applied field the last term Eq whose potential energy varies linearly as the particles move away from their equilibrium positions Let us try more examples The sum of the components of angular momenta recall that vector angular momentum is defined as of a collection of particles has the following classical expression Fsum_jN x_jp_yj y_jp_xjtag and the corresponding operator is If one transforms these Cartesian coordinates and derivatives into polar coordinates the above expression reduces to where is the azimuthal angle of the particle The component of the dipole moment for a collection of particles has a classical form of for which the quantum operator is where is the charge on the particle Notice that in this case classical and quantum forms are identical because contains no momentum operators Remember the mapping from to is straightforward only in terms of Cartesian coordinates To map a classical function given in terms of curvilinear coordinates even if they are orthogonal into its quantum operator is not at all straightforward The mapping can always be done in terms of Cartesian coordinates after which a transformation of the resulting coordinates and differential operators to a curvilinear system can be performed The relationship of these quantum mechanical operators to experimental measurement lies in the eigenvalues of the quantum operators Each such operator has a corresponding eigenvalue equation in which the are called eigenfunctions and the scalar numbers are called eigenvalues All such eigenvalue equations are posed in terms of a given operator in this case and those functions that acts on to produce the function back again but multiplied by a constant the eigenvalue Because the operator usually contains differential operators coming from the momentum these equations are differential equations Their solutions depend on the coordinates that contains as differential operators An example will help clarify these points The differential operator acts on what functions of to generate the same function back again but multiplied by a constant The answer is functions of the form since So we say that is an eigenfunction of and is the corresponding eigenvalue As I will discuss in more detail shortly the eigenvalues of the operator tell us the only values of the physical property corresponding to the operator that can be observed in a laboratory measurement Some operators that we encounter possess eigenvalues that are discrete or quantized For such properties laboratory measurement will result in only those discrete values Other operators have eigenvalues that can take on a continuous range of values for these properties laboratory measurement can give any value in this continuous range An important characteristic of the quantum mechanical operators formed as discussed above for any measurable property is the fact that they are Hermitian An operator that acts on coordinates denoted is Hermitian if int phi_I textbfF phi_J dq int textbfF phi_I phi_J dq tag or equivalently for any functions and The operator corresponding to any power of the coordinate itself is easy to show obeys this identity but what about the corresponding momentum operator Lets take the left hand side of the above identity for and rewrite it using integration by parts as follows If the functions and are assumed to vanish at the righthand side of this equation can be rewritten as So ihbar dfracq is indeed a Hermitian operator Moreover using the fact that and are Hermitian one can show that any operator formed using the rules described above is also Hermitian One thing you need to be aware of concerning the eigenfunctions of any Hermitian operator is that each pair of eigenfunctions and belonging to different eigenvalues display a property termed orthonormality This property means that not only may and each normalized so their probability densities integrate to unity int psi_n dx int psi_n dxtag but they are also orthogonal to each other where the complex conjugate of the first function appears only when the solutions contain imaginary components eg the functions which eigenfunctions of the component of angular momentum The orthogonality condition can be viewed as similar to the condition of two vectors and being perpendicular in which case their scalar sometimes called dot product vanishes textbfv_ cdot textbfv_ I want you to keep this property in mind because you will soon see that it is a characteristic of all eigenfunctions of any Hermitian operator It is common to write the integrals displaying the normalization and orthogonality conditions in the following socalled Dirac notation and where the and symbols represent and respectively and putting the two together in the construct implies the integration over the variables that y depends upon The Hermitian character of an operator means that this operator forms a Hermitian matrix when placed between pairs of functions and the coordinates are integrated over For example the matrix representation of an operator when acting on a set of functions denoted is For all of the operators formed following the rules stated earlier one finds that these matrices have the following property which makes the matrices what we call Hermitian If the functions upon which F acts and F itself have no imaginary parts ie are real then the matrices turn out to be symmetric F_IJ F_JI tag The importance of the Hermiticity or symmetry of these matrices lies in the fact that it can be shown that such matrices have all real ie not complex eigenvalues and have eigenvectors that are orthogonal or in the case of degenerate eigenvalues can be chosen to be orthogonal Lets see how these conditions follow from the Hermiticity property If the operator has two eigenfunctions and having eigenvalues and respectively then Multiplying this equation on the left by and integrating over the coordinates denoted that acts on gives The Hermitian nature of allows us to also write which because gives If is not equal to the only way the leftmost and rightmost terms in this equality can be equal is if which means the two eigenfunctions are orthogonal If the two eigenfunctions and have equal eigenvalues the above derivation can still be used to show that and are orthogonal to the other eigenfunctions etc of that have different eigenvalues For the eigenfunctions and that are degenerate ie have equal eigenvalues we cannot show that they are orthogonal because they need not be so However because any linear combination of these two functions is also an eigenfunction of having the same eigenvalue we can always choose a combination that makes and orthogonal to one another Finally for any given eigenfunction we have However the Hermitian character of F allows us to rewrite the left hand side of this equation as int psi_textbfF psi_ dq int textbfFpsi_psi_ dq lambda_ int psi_psi_ dq tag These two equations can only remain valid if which means that is a real number ie has no imaginary part So all quantum mechanical operators have real eigenvalues this is good since these eigenvalues are what can be measured in any experimental observation of that property and can be assumed to have orthogonal eigenfunctions It is important to keep these facts in mind because we make use of them many times throughout this text Wave functions The eigenfunctions of a quantum mechanical operator depend on the coordinates upon which the operator acts The particular operator that corresponds to the total energy of the system is called the Hamiltonian operator The eigenfunctions of this particular operator are called wave functions A special case of an operator corresponding to a physically measurable quantity is the Hamiltonian operator that relates to the total energy of the system The energy eigenstates of the system are functions of the coordinates that depends on and of time t The function gives the probability density for observing the coordinates at the values at time For a manyparticle system such as the molecule the wave function depends on many coordinates For it depends on the and or and coordinates of the ten electrons and the and or and coordinates of the oxygen nucleus and of the two protons a total of thirtynine coordinates appear in If one is interested in what the probability distribution is for finding the corresponding momenta at time the wave function has to first be written as a combination of the eigenfunctions of the momentum operators Expressing in this manner is possible because the momentum operator is Hermitian and it can be shown that the eigenfunctions of any Hermitian operator form a complete set of functions The momentum operators eigenfunctions are and they obey These eigenfunctions can also be shown to be orthonormal Expanding in terms of these normalized momentum eigenfunctions gives We can find the expansion coefficients by multiplying the above equation by the complex conjugate of another labeled momentum eigenfunction and integrating over The quantities then give the probability of finding momentum at time In classical mechanics the coordinates and their corresponding momenta are functions of time The state of the system is then described by specifying and In quantum mechanics the concept that qj is known as a function of time is replaced by the concept of the probability density for finding coordinate qj at a particular value at a particular time or the probability density for finding momentum at time The Hamiltonian eigenstates are especially important in chemistry because many of the tools that chemists use to study molecules probe the energy states of the molecule For example most spectroscopic methods are designed to determine which energy state electronic vibrational rotational nuclear sp_in etc a molecule is in However there are other experimental measurements that measure other properties eg the component of angular momentum or the total angular momentum As stated earlier if the state of some molecular system is characterized by a wave function Y that happens to be an eigenfunction of a quantum mechanical operator F one can immediately say something about what the outcome will be if the physical property F corresponding to the operator F is measured In particular since where is one of the eigenvalues of we know that the value will be observed if the property is measured while the molecule is described by the wave function In fact once a measurement of a physical quantity has been carried out and a particular eigenvalue has been observed the systems wave function becomes the eigenfunction that corresponds to that eigenvalue That is the act of making the measurement causes the systems wave function to become the eigenfunction of the property that was measured This is what is meant when one hears that the act of making a measurement can change the state of the system in quantum mechanics What happens if some other property G whose quantum mechanical operator is is measured in a case where we have already determined We know from what was said earlier that some eigenvalue mk of the operator G will be observed in the measurement But will the molecules wave function remain after G is measured the eigenfunction of or will the measurement of G cause Y to be altered in a way that makes the molecules state no longer an eigenfunction of It turns out that if the two operators F and G obey the condition then when the property G is measured the wave function will remain unchanged This property that the order of application of the two operators does not matter is called commutation that is we say the two operators commute if they obey this property Let us see how this property leads to the conclusion about Y remaining unchanged if the two operators commute In particular we apply the G operator to the above eigenvalue equation from which we concluded that Next we use the commutation to rewrite the lefthand side of this equation and use the fact that is a scalar number to thus obtain So now we see that itself is an eigenfunction of F having eigenvalue So unless there are more than one eigenfunction of F corresponding to the eigenvalue ie unless this eigenvalue is degenerate must itself be proportional to We write this proportionality conclusion as G chi_j mu_j chi_j tag which means that is also an eigenfunction of G This in turn means that measuring the property G while the system is described by the wave function does not change the wave function it remains If there are more than one function that are eigenfunctions of F having the same eigenvalue then the relation only allows us to conclude that is some combination of these degenerate functions Below I offer some examples that i hope will clarify what these rules mean and how the relate to laboratory measurements In summary when the operators corresponding to two physical properties commute once one measures one of the properties and thus causes the system to be an eigenfunction of that operator subsequent measurement of the second operator will if the eigenvalue of the first operator is not degenerate produce a unique eigenvalue of the second operator and will not change the system wave function If either of the two properties is subsequently measured even over and over again the wave function will remain unchanged and the value observed for the property being measured will remain the same as the original eigenvalue observed However if the two operators do not commute one simply cannot reach the above conclusions In such cases measurement of the property corresponding to the first operator will lead to one of the eigenvalues of that operator and cause the system wave function to become the corresponding eigenfunction However subsequent measurement of the second operator will produce an eigenvalue of that operator but the system wave function will be changed to become an eigenfunction of the second operator and thus no longer the eigenfunction of the first I think an example will help clarify this discussion Let us consider the following orbital angular momentum operators for particles or and It turns out that the operator can be shown to commute with any one of or but or do not commute with one another we will discuss these operators in considerably more detail in Chapter section for now please accept these statements Let us assume a measurement of is carried out and one obtains the value Thus far all one knows is that the system can be described by a wave function that is some combination of etc angular momentum functions having different values but all having but one does not know the amplitudes telling how much a given value contributes to One can express as such a linear combination because the Hermitian quantum mechanical operators formed as described above can be shown to possess complete sets of eigenfunctions this means that any function of the appropriate variables can be written as a linear combination of these eigenfunctions as done above If one subsequently carries out a measurement of the fact that and commute means that this second measurement will not alter the fact that contains only contributions with but it will result in observing only one specific value The probability of observing any particular value will be given by Once this measurement is realized the wave function will contain only terms having that specific value and For example if is found we know the wave function has and so we know it is a Fsymmetry function with but we dont know any more That is we dont know if it is an etc Ffunction What now happens if we make a measurement of when the system is in the state recall this is a value of the component of angular momentum Because and commute the measurement of will not alter the fact that contains only components However because and do not commute we can not assume that is still an eigenfunction of it will be a combination of eigenfunctions of having but having values between and with m now referring to the eigenvalue of no longer to When is measured the value will be found with probability after which the wave function will be the eigenfunction of and and no longer an eigenfunction of I understand that these rules of quantum mechanics can be confusing but I assure you they are based on laboratory observations about how atoms ions and molecules behave when subjected to statespecific measurements So I urge you to get used to the fact that quantum mechanics has rules and behaviors that may be new to you but need to be mastered by you The Schrödinger Equation This equation is an eigenvalue equation for the energy or Hamiltonian operator its eigenvalues provide the only allowed energy levels of the system The TimeDependent Equation If the Hamiltonian operator contains the time variable explicitly one must solve the timedependent Schrödinger equation Before moving deeper into understanding what quantum mechanics means it is useful to learn how the wave functions are found by applying the basic equation of quantum mechanics the Schrödinger equation to a few exactly soluble model problems Knowing the solutions to these easy yet chemically very relevant models will then facilitate learning more of the details about the structure of quantum mechanics The Schrödinger equation is a differential equation depending on time and on all of the spatial coordinates necessary to describe the system at hand thirtynine for the example cited above It is usually written where is the unknown wavefunction and is the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system This Hermitian operator is called the Hamiltonian and is formed as stated above by first writing down the classical mechanical expression for the total energy kinetic plus potential in Cartesian coordinates and momenta and then replacing all classical momenta by their quantum mechanical operators For the example used above the classical mechanical energy of all thirteen particles is where the indices and are used to label the ten electrons whose thirty Cartesian coordinates and thirty Cartesian momenta are and and and label the three nuclei whose charges are denoted and whose nine Cartesian coordinates and nine Cartesian momenta are and The electron and nuclear masses are denoted and respectively The corresponding Hamiltonian operator is H sum_i Big frachbarm_e fracpartialpartial q_i Big frac sum_jne i fracer_ij sum_asum_i fracZ_aer_ia sum_a Big frachbarm_a fracpartialpartial q_i Big frac sum_bne a fracZ_aZ_ber_ab tag where and denote the distances between electron pairs electrons and nuclei and nuclear pairs respectively Notice that is a second order differential operator in the space of the thirtynine Cartesian coordinates that describe the positions of the ten electrons and three nuclei It is a second order operator because the momenta appear in the kinetic energy as and and the quantum mechanical operator for each momentum is of first order The Schrödinger equation for the example at hand then reads leftsum_i Big frachbarm_e fracpartialpartial q_i Big frac sum_jne i fracer_ij sum_asum_i fracZ_aer_ia right Psi leftsum_a Big frachbarm_e fracpartialpartial q_a Big frac sum_bne a fracZ_aZ_ber_ab right Psi i hbar fracpartial Psipartial t tag The Hamiltonian in this case contains nowhere An example of a case where does contain occurs for example when the an oscillating electric field along the axis interacts with the electrons and nuclei and a term is added to the Hamiltonian Here and denote the coordinates of the nucleus and the electron respectively The TimeIndependent Equation If the Hamiltonian operator does not contain the time variable explicitly one can solve the timeindependent Schrödinger equation In cases where the classical energy and hence the quantum Hamiltonian do not contain terms that are explicitly time dependent eg interactions with time varying external electric or magnetic fields would add to the above classical energy expression time dependent terms the separations of variables techniques can be used to reduce the Schrödinger equation to a timeindependent equation In such cases is not explicitly time dependent so one can assume that is of the form nb this step is an example of the use of the separations of variables method to solve a differential equation Substituting this ansatz into the timedependent Schrödinger equation gives Psiq_J ihbar fracpartial Fpartial t Ft textbfHPsiq_J tag Dividing by then gives Since is only a function of time and is only a function of the spatial coordinates and because the left hand and right hand sides must be equal for all values of t and of both the left and right hand sides must equal a constant If this constant is called E the two equations that are embodied in this separated Schrödinger equation read as follows The first of these equations is called the timeindependent Schrödinger equation it is an eigenvalue equation in which one is asked to find functions that yield a constant multiple of themselves when acted on by the Hamiltonian operator Such functions are called eigenfunctions of and the corresponding constants are called eigenvalues of For example if were of the form then functions of the form would be eigenfunctions because frachbarI fracpartialpartial phi expi mphi fracmhbarI expi mphitag In this case is the eigenvalue In this example the Hamiltonian contains the square of an angular momentum operator recall earlier that we showed the component of angular momentum for a single particle is to equal When the Schrödinger equation can be separated to generate a timeindependent equation describing the spatial coordinate dependence of the wave function the eigenvalue must be returned to the equation determining to find the time dependent part of the wave function By solving once is known one obtains and the full wave function can be written as For the above example the time dependence is expressed by In such cases the spatial probability density does not depend upon time because the product reduces to unity In summary whenever the Hamiltonian does not depend on time explicitly one can solve the timeindependent Schrödinger equation first and then obtain the time dependence as once the energy is known In the case of molecular structure theory it is a quite daunting task even to approximately solve the full Schrödinger equation because it is a partial differential equation depending on all of the coordinates of the electrons and nuclei in the molecule For this reason there are various approximations that one usually implements when attempting to study molecular structure using quantum mechanics It should be noted that it is possible to prepare in the laboratory even when the Hamiltonian contains no explicit time dependence wave functions that are time dependent and that have timedependent spatial probability densities For example one can prepare a state of the Hydrogen atom that is a superposition of the and wave functions where the two eigenstates obey and When does not contain explicitly it is possible to then express in terms of as follows This function which is a superposition of and functions does indeed obey the full timedependent Schrödinger equation The probability of observing the system in the state if a measurement capable of making this determination were carried out is and the probability of finding it in the state is both of which are independent of time This does not mean that or the spatial probability density describes is timeindependent because the product contains cross terms that depend on time It is important to note that applying to such a superposition state in the manner shown above which then produces a superposition of states each of whose amplitudes carries its own time dependence only works when has no time dependence If were timedependent acting on would contain an additional factor involving as a result of which one would not have Contributors and Attributions
