The Significance of The Machinebased Statement of The Second Law Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers Our entropybased statement of the second law asserts the definition and basic properties of entropy that we need in order to make predictions about natural processes The ultimate justification for these assertions is that the predictions they make agree with experimental observations We have devoted considerable attention to arguments that develop the definition and properties of entropy from the machinebased statement of the second law These arguments parallel those that were made historically as these concepts were developed Understanding these arguments greatly enhances our appreciation for the relationship between the properties of the entropy function and the changes that can occur in various physical systems While these arguments demonstrate that our machinebased statement implies the entropybased statement we introduce additional postulates in order to make them These include the premise that the pressure temperature volume and energy of a reversible system are continuous functions of one another Duhems theorem the tiling theorem and the presumption that the conclusions we develop for pressurevolume work are valid for any form of work We can sum up this situation by saying that our machinebased statement serves a valuable heuristic purpose The entropybased statement of the second law is a postulate that we infer by reasoning about the consequences of the machinebased statement When we want to apply the second law to physical systems the entropybased statement and other statements that we introduce below are much more useful Finally we note that our machinebased statement of the second law is not the only statement of this type Other similar statements have been given The logical relationships among them are interesting and they can be used to develop the entropybased statement of the second law by arguments similar to those we make in Section to Section
