The Variance of the Average The Central Limit Theorem Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Paul EllgenRetired Teach Chemistry at Oklahoma School of Science Mathematics No headers The central limit theorem establishes very important relationships between the statistics for two distributions that are related in a particular way It enables us to understand some important features of physical systems The central limit theorem concerns the distribution of averages If we have some original distribution and sample it three times we can calculate the average of these three data points Call this average We could repeat this activity and obtain a second average of three values We can do this repeatedly generating averages Several things will be true about these averages The set of all of the possible averagesofthree is itself a distribution This averagesofthree distribution is different from the original distribution Each averageofthree is a value of the random variable associated with the averagesofthree distribution Each of the is an estimate of the mean of the original distribution The distribution of the will be less spread out than the original distribution There is nothing unique about averaging three values We could sample the original distribution seven times and compute the average of these seven values calling the result Repeating we could generate averages All of the things we say about the averagesofthree are also true of these averagesofseven However we can now say something more The distribution of the will be less spread out than the distribution of the The corresponding probability density functions are sketched in Figure Figure The Variance of an Average of is proportional to The central limit theorem relates the mean and variance of the distribution of averages to the mean and variance of the original distribution If random samples of values are taken from a distribution whose mean is µ and whose variance is averages of these values are approximately normally distributed with a mean of µ and a variance of The approximation to the normal distribution becomes better as becomes larger It turns out that the number of trials that is needed to get a good estimate of the variance is substantially larger than the number required to get a good estimate of the mean
