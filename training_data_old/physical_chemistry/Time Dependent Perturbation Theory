Coupling to a ContinuumApplication Experimental OscillationsApplication Collisionally induced TransitionsReferencesContributors and Attributions When dealing with the effects of external perturbations eg applied fields collisions with other species one needs to have a way to estimate the probabilities and rates of transitions among states of the system of interest induced by these perturbations Timedependent perturbation theory TDPT offers a framework within which such estimates can be achieved Derivation In deriving the working equations of TDPT one begins with the timedependent Schrödinger equation in which is the Hamiltonian for the system whose transitions are to be probed and is the perturbation caused by the external field or the collision The wave function that solves this equation is expanded in an orderbyorder manner as in conventional perturbation theory Here is the eigenfunction of from which transitions to other eigenstates denoted of are being considered Because in the absence of the external perturbation the states of are known to vary with time as this component of the time dependence of the total wave function is included in the above expansion Then the firstorder correction is expanded in terms of the complete set of states after which the expansion coefficients become the unknowns to be solved for It should be noted that this derivation treats the zerothorder states and as eigenfunctions of However in most practical applications of TDPT and are not known exactly and in fact are usually approximated by using variational or perturbative methods eg to treat differences between HF meanfield and true Coulombic interactions among electrons So the derivation of TDPT that we are pursuing assumes the and are exact eigenfunctions When the final TDPT working equations are thus obtained one usually substitutes perturbative or variational approximations to and into these equations Substituting the orderbyorder expansion into the Schrödinger equation

present discussion I will limit myself to the general picture of TDPT rather than focusing on any of these particular forms of spectroscopic transitions To proceed further one needs to say something about how the perturbation depends on time In the most common application of TDPT the perturbation is assumed to consist of a term that depends on spatial variables denoted multiplied by a timedependent factor of sinusoidal character An example of such a perturbation is provided by the electric dipole potential VttextbfEcdot esum_n Z_n textbfR_n e sum_i textbfr_i cosomega t

for the possibility that photons over a range of frequencies may impinge on the molecules we can proceed with the derivation for photons of a given frequency and after obtaining our final result average over a distribution of frequencies characterized by a function giving the number of photons with frequencies between and For perturbations that do not vary in a sinusoidal manner eg a perturbation arising from a collision with another molecule the derivation follows a different path at this point application below Because spectroscopic timedependent perturbations are extremely common in chemistry we will focus much of our attention to this class of perturbations in this Chapter To proceed deriving the working equations of TDPT the above expression for is inserted into the differential equation for the expansion coefficients and the equation is integrated from an initial time to a final time These times describe when the external perturbation is first turned on and when it is turned off respectively For example a laser whose photon intensity profile is described by might be pulsed on from to and one wants to know what fraction of the molecules initially in have undergone transitions to each of the Alternatively the molecules may be flowing in a stream that passes through a laser light source that is continually on entering the laser beam at and exiting from the laser beam at In either case the molecules would be exposed to the photons from until The result of integrating the differential equation is beginsplitC_ftfracihbarint_t_it_flangle psi_fvrpsi_fr

narrower and higher such that in the limit the area under this plot approaches The importance of this observation about the area under the plot shown in Figure can be appreciated by returning to our result and introducing the fact that the photon source used to induce the transitions being studied most likely is not perfectly monochromatic If it is characterized as suggested earlier by a distribution of frequencies that is broader than the width of the large central peak in Figure nb this will be true if the time duration is long enough then when we average over to obtain a result

psi_fvrpsi_frranglethbarfomega_flangle C_ft rangle label We are allowed to write the integral over as ranging from to because the function shown in Figure is so sharply peaked around that extending the range of integration makes no difference We are allowed to factor the out of the integral as f by assuming the light sources distribution function is very smoothly varying ie not changing much in the narrow range of frequencies around where the function in Figure is sharply peaked The result of this derivation of TDPT is the above expression for the average probability of observing a transition from state to state This probability is seen to grow linearly with the time duration over which the system is exposed to the light source Because we carried out this derivation within firstorder perturbation theory we should trust this result only under conditions where the effects of the perturbation are small In the context of the example considered here this means only for short times That is we should view as expressing the shorttime estimate of the probability of a transition from to and obtained as as expressing the initial rate of such transitions within the firstorder TDPT approximation It should be noted that the rate expression given above will not be valid if the time duration t of the perturbation does not obey only when this condition is met an the function shown in Figure be integrated to generate a probability prediction that grows linearly with time So one has to be careful when using pulsed lasers of very short duration to not employ the simplified rate expression given above eg eV corresponds to a frequency of ca x s so to study an electronic transition of this energy one needs to use a light source of duration significantly longer than s to make use of the simplified result The working equations of TDPT given above allow one to estimate because this is a firstorder theory the rates of transitions from one quantum state to another induced by a perturbation whose spatial dependence is characterized by and whose time dependence is sinusoidal The same kind of coupling matrix elements as we experienced in timeindependent PT govern the selection rules and intensities for these transitions so there is no need to repeat how symmetry can be used to analyze these integrals Before closing this treatment of TDPT it is useful to address a few issues that were circumvented in the derivation presented above Application Coupling to a Continuum In some cases one is interested in transitions from a particular initial state into a manifold of states that exist in a continuum having energies between and This occurs for example when treating photoionization of a neutral or photodetachment of an anion here the ejected electron exists in a continuum wave function whose density of states is given by the formulas discussed in Chapter In such cases the expression given above for the rate is modified by summing over all final states having energies within and Returning to the earlier expression intrhoE_ffracpilangle psi_fvrpsi_frranglehbar int_inftyinfty fomegafracsinomegaomega_ftomegaomega_fdomega dE_f label using and assuming the matrix elements do not vary significantly within the narrow range between and one arrives at a rate expression of which is much like we obtained earlier but now contains the density of states In some experiments one may not have only a single state that can absorb light of a given frequency w in such a situation attenuation of the light source at this frequency can occur through absorptions from many initial states into all possible final states whose energy differs from that of the initial state by In this case the correct expression for the total rate of absorption of photons of energy is obtained by averaging the above result over the probabilities of the system being in various initial states which we label Here the function guarantees that only states and whose energies differ by are permitted to enter the sum The nature of the initialstate probability depends on what kind of experiment is being carried out might be a Boltzmann distribution if the initial states are in thermal equilibrium for example Application Experimental Oscillations In Figure the function is plotted for one value of as a function of There also appear in this figure dots that represent experimental data These data were obtained by allowing a stream of molecules to flow through a laser beam of width with the laser frequency tuned to From the flow velocity of the stream and the laser beam width one can determine the duration over which the molecules were exposed to the light source After the molecules exited the laser beam they were probed to determine whether they were in an excited state This experiment was repeated for various values of the frequency The population of excited states was then plotted as a function of to obtain the data plotted in Figure This experiment is described in the text Molecules and Radiation J I Steinfeld MIT Press Cambridge Mass This kind of experiment provided direct proof of the oscillatory frequency dependence observed in the population of excited states as predicted in our derivation of TDPT Application Collisionally induced Transitions To give an example of how one proceeds in TDPT when the perturbation is not oscillatory in time let us consider an atom located at the origin of our coordinate system that experiences a collision with an ion of charge c whose trajectory is described in Figure Figure An atom at the origin undergoing a collision with an ion of charge moving along the axis with constant velocity As an approximation we assume that the ion moves in a straight line characterized by an impact parameter and a velocity this would be appropriate if the ion were moving so fast that it would not be deflected by interactions with the atom that the perturbation caused by the ion on the electrons of the atom at the origin can be represented by where is the position of the ith electron in the atom and is the position of the ion The time dependence of the perturbation arises from the motion of the ion along the axis Writing the distance as and expanding in inverse powers of we can express the ionatom interaction potential as The first term contains no factors dependent on the atoms electronic coordinates so it plays no role in causing electronic transitions In the second term the factor can be neglected compared to the terms because the ion is assumed to be somewhat distant from the atoms valence electrons To derive an equation for the probability of the atom undergoing a transition from to one returns to the TDPT expression and substitutes the above expression for the perturbation to obtain This is the equation that must be solved to evaluate by integrating from to representing the full collision with the ion starting far to the left on the axis and proceeding far to the right There are two limiting cases in which the solution is straightforward First if the time duration of the collision ie the time over which the ion is close to the atom is long compared to where then the integrand will oscillate repeatedly during the time as a result of which the integral will be vanishingly small So in this socalled adiabatic case ie with the ion moving slowly relative to the oscillation frequency electronic transitions should not be expected In the other limit the factor will remain approximately equal to unity so the integration needed reduces to The integral involving vanishes because is odd and the remainder of the integrand is an even function of The integral involving can be performed by trigonometric substitution so the denominator reduces to and gives This result suggests that the probability of a transition should vary as the square of the ions charge and inversely with the speed of the collision Of course this result can not be trusted if the speed is too low because then the condition will not hold This example shows how one must rederive the equations of TDPT when dealing with perturbations whose timedependence is not sinusoidal References For the reader who wishes a
