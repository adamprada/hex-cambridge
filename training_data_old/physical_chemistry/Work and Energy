expansionContributors and Attributions Temperature pressure and volume are important variables in the description of physical systems They will also be important to describe how energy flows from one system to another Generally energy can flow in two important forms work and heat The bookkeeping needed to track the flow of energy is what the subject of Thermodynamics is all about so these topics will be discussed at length in subsequent chapters However a little bit of review is in order just to set the foundation for the discussions that are forthcoming Energy Energy is an important entity in the modern world We use energy to light our homes drive our cars and power our electronic devices According to Richard Smalley cowinner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry energy is one of the if not the biggest challenge we face moving into the st century energysenategov Energy is at the core of virtually every problem facing humanity We cannot afford to get this wrong Somehow we must find the basis for energy prosperity for ourselves and the rest of humanity for the st century By the middle of this century we should assume we will need to at least double world energy production from its current level with most of this coming from some clean sustainable COfree source For worldwide peace and prosperity it needs to be cheap Richard Smalley Testimony to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources April Energy can be measured in a multitude of different units including joules J kilojoules kJ calories cal kilocalories kcal as well as several other set of units such as kJmol or kcalmol A calorie cal was once defined as the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of g of water by C This definition suggests a convenient property of water called the specific heat The modern definition of a calorie is joule where a joule is the energy necessary to move a mass a distance of m against a resisting force of N A dietary Calorie Cal is equal to cal or kcal and is often listed on the labels of food containers to indicate the energy content of the food inside Energy can take the form of potential energy stored energy and kinetic energy realized energy forms Kinetic energy is the energy of motion On the other hand potential energy can be defined as the energy stored in a system that can be converted to kinetic energy someplace in the universe Kinetic energy of a particle can be expressed as where is the mass of the particle and is the magnitude of its velocity or speed Equation reftransKE describes the kinetic energy associated with translation other expressions exist for different motions eg rotation or vibration An example of a system in which energy is converted between kinetic energy and potential energy is a Hookes Law oscillator According to Hookes Law the force acting on an object is proportional in magnitude to the displacement of the object from an equilibrium position and opposite in sign In this equation is the force is the displacement from equilibrium and is the constant of proportionality The negative sign is necessary to insure that the force acting on the object is one that will tend to restore it to an equilibrium position irrespective of whether is positive or negative As the object that follows Hookes Law moves from its equilibrium position the kinetic energy of its motion is converted into potential energy until there is no more kinetic energy left At this point the change in displacement will change direction returning the object to the equilibrium position by converting potential energy back into kinetic energy Figure An example of a harmonic oscillator As the object is displaced in the along the xaxis in the case shown in Figure this would be accomplished by stretching or compressing the spring the potential energy increases The force acting on the object will also increase as the object is displaced and will be directed opposite of the direction of displacement Equation refhook According to Newtonian physics the potential energy is given by the negative integral of the force with respect to position U x int Fx dx labelenergy Substituting Equation refhook in Equation refenergy yields With the proper choice of coordinate system and other definitions the constant of integration can be arbitrarily made to be zero for example by choosing it to offset any other forces acting on the object such as the force due to gravity The kinetic energy is then given by the total energy minus the potential energy since the total energy must be constant due to the conservation of energy in the system Work Work is defined as the amount of energy expended to move a mass against a resisting force For a mass being moved along a surface the amount of energy expended must be sufficient to overcome the resisting force perhaps due to friction and also sufficient to cause motion along the entire path Figure The work of displacement The energy expended as work in this case if the force is independent of the position of the object being moved is given by where F is the magnitude of the resisting force and Dx is the displacement of the object The negative sign is necessary since the force is acting in the opposite direction of the motion A more general expression and one that can be used if the force is not constant over the entire motion is This expression can then be integrated including any dependence might have on as needed for a given system Another important way that work can be defined includes that for the expansion of a gas sample against an external pressure In this case the displacement is defined by a change in volume for the sample This is a very convenient expression and will be used quite often when discussing the work expended in the expansion of a gas The conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy generally is accomplished through work which is done someplace in the universe As such the concepts of energy and work are inexorably intertwined They will be central to the study of thermodynamics The work of a reversible expansion An important case of limiting ideal behavior is that of the reversible expansion For a change to be reversible there can be no net force pushing the change in one direction or the other In order for this to be the case the internal pressure that of the system and external pressure that of the surroundings must be the same In this case the work of expansion can be calculated by integrating the expression for dw Making a simple substitution from the ideal gas law allows for the expression in terms of volume and temperature If the temperature is constant so that it can be placed before the integral the expression becomes w nRT int_V_V_ dfracdVV nRT ln left dfracV_V_ right labelworkIG where and are the initial and final volumes of the expansion respectively Example Consider mol of an ideal gas expanding isothermally at K from an initial volume of L to a final volume of L What is the final pressure of the gas Calculate the work of the expansion if it occurs against a constant external pressure equal to the final pressure you have calculated reversibly Solution First lets calculate the final pressure via Equation refIGL p dfracnRTV dfracmole atmLmol KK L atm This may be a relationship you remember from General Chemistry that mole of an idea gas occupies L at oC Okay now for the irreversible expansion against a constant external pressure so But what the heck is an atm L It is actually a fairly simply thing to convert from units of atm L to J by using the ideal gas law constant Note that the negative sign indicated that the system is expending energy by doing work on the surroundings This concept will be vital in the Chapter Now for the reversible pathway The work done by the system can be calculated for this change using Equation refworkIG Notes First notice how the value for the gas law constant R was chosen in order to match the units required in the problem Read and recite that previous sentence to yourself a few times The incorrect choice of the value of R is one of the most common errors made by students in physical chemistry By learning how the units will dictate your choice of R you will save yourself a considerable number of headaches as you learn physical chemistry Second You may note that the magnitude of work done by the system in the reversible expansion is larger than that of the irreversible expansion This will always be the case There are many cases of limiting ideal behavior which we use to derive andor explore the nature of chemical systems The most obvious case perhaps is that of the Ideal Gas Law Contributors and Attributions Patrick E Fleming Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry California
