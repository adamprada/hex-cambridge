ΔA ΔG and Maximum Work Last updated Save as PDF Page ID Contributed by Patrick FlemingAssistant Professor Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University East Bay No headers The functions and are oftentimes referred to as free energy functions The reason for this is that they are a measure of the maximum work in the case of or non pV work in the case of that is available from a process To show this consider the total differentials First consider the differential of Substituting the combined first and second laws for but expressing the work term as yields And cancelling the terms gives or at constant temperature Since the only assumption made here was that the change is reversible allowing for the substitution of for and for a reversible change is the maximum amount of work it follows that gives the maximum work that can be produced from a process at constant temperature Similarly a simple expression can be derived for Starting from the total differential of Using an expression for where and is split into two terms one describing the work of expansion and the other describing any other type of work electrical stretching etc can be expressed as dG cancelTdS cancelpdV dw_e cancelpdV Vdp cancelTdS SdT Cancelling the and terms leaves So at constant temperature and pressure This implies that gives the maximum amount of non pV work that can be extracted from a process This concept of and giving the maximum work under the specified conditions is where the term free energy comes from as it is the energy that is free to do work in the surroundings If a system is to be optimized to do work in the soundings for example a steam engine that may do work by moving a locomotive the functions A and will be important to understand It will therefore be useful to understand how these functions change with changing conditions such as volume temperature and pressure Contributors Patrick E Fleming Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry California State University East Bay
